<h1>Chapter 11: The Electromagnetic Tensor<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-11-the-electromagnetic-tensor" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Many introductory relativity textbooks stop with dynamics, but I think
it’s important to include some of the implications of realtivity
theory for the understanding of electricity and magnetism.  There are
two reasons why it’s important to see how SR affects E&amp;M: first, for
mechanics, the effects of relativity are completely negligible in our
world of physics professors and dump trucks.  The weird effects only show
up at speeds near the speed of light, and for most day-to-day processes
you can blissfully ignore them.</p>
<p>Within the context of electricity, however, relativistic effects
occur, and are important, at <em>any</em> speed.  Even for the literal
snail’s pace of the average drift speed of a 1 A current in a copper
wire, the differing observations in reference frames in relative
motion are obvious and unavoidable.</p>
<p>Second, the theory of electrodynamics that culminates in Maxwell’s
Equations is automatically consistent with SR.  Newtonian mechanics
needs massive modifications to work with SR, but the bulk of
relativistic E&amp;M is learning how to write it in four-vector notation
and remarking, “Wow!  It works!”  For a full treatment of this topic,
I recommend an advanced electrodynamics book such as Griffiths.  In
this eBook, I only plan to introduce the subject, not explore all the
implications.</p>

<p>Before we dive into tackling how relativity implies we must rethink
E&amp;M, let’s first walk through a classical understanding of a simple
problem.  Then we will recast that problem through a relativistic lens
and see how it invites a different understanding of the phenomenon.
We will start with the force on an electric charge moving parallel to
a current-carrying wire.  The situation is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#classicfig"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 15</span></a>
as a schematic.  A wire carries a current <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> to the right.  Meanwhile
a charge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span> is moving to the right with a velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{u}\)</span> at a
distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> from the center of the wire.  We observe, empirically, that
the charge experiences an upward force (toward the wire) with a
magnitude of</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-fclassic">
<span class="eqno">(171)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-fclassic" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\vec{F} = -\hat{r} \frac{qu\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}\]</div>
<p>and this force remains perpendicular to the motion of the particle,
no matter how we rotate the system around the wire.</p>
<p>We therefore invent a field we  call <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{B}\)</span> and we say there’s
a magnetic force <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{F}_m = q\vec{u}\times\vec{B}\)</span>.  To make that
force line up with the observed force, we say the field <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{B}\)</span>
points tangent to a circle around the wire and has a magnitude of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu_0 I/2\pi r\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-relativistic-model">
<h3>The Relativistic Model<a class="headerlink" href="#the-relativistic-model" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>As with most relativity problems, this one comes down to setting up
the situation in different reference frames and then switching between
them with Lorentz transformations.  There are three frames we will
need to compare, because there are two different kinds of motion (the
current and the charge), and we need to compare them both to a common
reference frame.  Or to put it another way, we have the initial frame
in which the charge has a velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{u}\)</span>, we have the rest frame
of the charge, and then we will need the rest frame of the <em>current</em>,
as well.</p>
<p>Let us begin with the “lab frame”, which I will call “Frame A”, which
corresponds to the situation described in the previous section.  There
is a current <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> to the right, but I am going to break this down into
two parts: a positive current going right and a negative current going
left.  Each current comprises half the charge density, but they are
equal and opposite densities, so the total charge density is zero, but
the total current is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> to the right.  This way of conceptualizing the
setup is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#frameafig"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 16</span></a>, with the positive current in
red and the negative current in blue.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="frameafig">
<a class="bg-primary mb-1 reference internal image-reference" href="_images/frameAfig.png"><img alt="frameApicture" class="bg-primary mb-1" src="_images/frameAfig.png" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 16 </span><span class="caption-text">Schematic of a particular way of visualizing the current <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> in a
reference frame where the total charge density of the wire is zero.
We define the current as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\lambda v\)</span>, but there is a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+\lambda\)</span> moving
to the right (red) and a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-\lambda\)</span> moving to the left (blue).  The sum
of the two <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> is zero, but since the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> values are also opposite,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda v\)</span> adds up instead of cancelling.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#frameafig" title="Permalink to this image">#</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We then need to transform into a frame moving with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_R=u\)</span> to the
right.  In this frame, which I will call Frame B, the charge <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+q\)</span> is
at rest.  According to the classic magnetic force model (Equation
<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-fclassic">(171)</a>), the magnetic force on the charge should be zero.  It
is not moving, so it cannot experience a magnetic force.  However,
since an observer in Frame A observes the charge being attracted to
the wire, an observer in Frame B must also observe the charge being
attracted to the wire.  But how, if there is no force?  No <em>magnetic</em>
force!  There could be a <em>different</em> force.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This is actually the exact sort of dilemma that led Einstein to develop
SR in the first place.  How could you have a magnetic force in one
reference frame, and an electric force in another reference frame?
Shouldn’t the laws of Physics be the same in all reference frames?
His 1905 paper that introduced SR to the world was not called “Special

<p>In Frame B, illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#framebfig"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 17</span></a>, lengths along the
direction of relative motion will be contracted.  When we talk about a
charge density <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>, we are talking about a certain number of
charges <em>per</em> <em>length</em>.  So the charge densities in the wire will
change, and since these sets of charges have different velocities,
relative to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{v}_R\)</span>, they will contract by different amounts.
Given our formula for length contraction, we know</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-lambdapm">

<p>In this frame, the two charge densities will <strong>not</strong>
cancel out, since they will no longer be equal.  The wire will <strong>not</strong>
be electrically neutral.</p>

<p>To be more specific, instead of talking about just one <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>, we
must now talk about a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_+\)</span> and a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_-\)</span>, since they will
be different.  (Note that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_\pm\)</span> is explicitly defined in Frame
B).  To know how much they are contracted, we have to know their
speeds.  We have a formula for that:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-vplusminus">
<span class="eqno">(174)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-vplusminus" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[v_\pm = \frac{v\mp u}{1\mp uv}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> (the speed of the current) and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span> (the relative velocity
between A and B) are measured in Frame A.  On the other hand,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-gammapm">
<span class="eqno">(175)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-gammapm" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\gamma_\pm = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v_{\pm}^2/c^2}}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\pm\)</span> is measured in Frame B.</p>
<p>But what are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\pm\)</span> measured with respect <em>to</em>?  These velocities
represent the velocities of the charges in the wire, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-\)</span>
charges separately, but velocity relative to what?</p>
<p>We need a Frame C, in which the positive charges in the wire are at
rest.  In Frame C, the charge density of the positive charges will be
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_0\)</span> (we don’t actually need to know what the charge density of
the negative charges in Frame C is – we just need an anchor point
with which to compare the others).  If the positive charges are at rest
in Frame C, that means that Frame A is moving with speed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> with
respect to Frame C!  The original speed of the charges in Frame A was
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span>.  So this means that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda = \gamma\lambda_0\)</span>, where
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We now have all the pieces we need to pull it all together.  To make
the math easier to write, I will take <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c=1\)</span> for a while, and then put
the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> back later.  From comparing Frames A and C, we know <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda =
\gamma\lambda_0\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-v^2}\)</span>.  From comparing Frames
B and C, we know <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda_\pm = \pm\gamma_\pm\lambda_0\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma_\pm
= 1/\sqrt{1-v_\pm^2}\)</span>.  We also know that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\pm = (v\mp u)/(1\mp vu)\)</span>.
If we plug in the velocity formula for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\pm\)</span>, we get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-gampmuv">
<span class="eqno">(176)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-gampmuv" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\gamma_\pm = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v\mp u}{1\mp uv}\right)^2}}\]</div>

<p>Note the factors of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2vu\)</span> will cancel, as whatever sign they have, the
other will be opposite.  That will leave <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1+v^2u^2-v^2-u^2\)</span> in the
denominator, but that’s just the same as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1-v^2)(1-u^2)\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/\sqrt{1-v^2}\)</span> is just <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span>!  So this becomes</p>

<p>Now we have equations for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma_\pm\)</span>, we can figure out the total
charge density in Frame B:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-lamtotb">

\lambda\left[\frac{-2vu}{\sqrt{1-u^2}}\right]\]</div>
<p>Note that the total density in Frame B is negative!  There are some
important pieces in this equation we can pull out.  Notice the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\lambda v\)</span>.  This is what we would call <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(I\)</span> in the original Frame A.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You will note that nothing in this analysis requires that any of the
speeds, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_\pm\)</span>, be close to the speed of light.  In
fact, you may remember from Intro E&amp;M that even a current as large as
1 A in a copper wire only requires an average drift speed of something
like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{-4}\)</span> m/s.  And yet the moving charge <em>will</em> be deflected,
even at small speeds, and so if you want to model that force without
introducing magnetism, you must use SR, even with tiny speeds.  In
mechanics, you generally need to move at speeds near <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> to observe
the relativistic effects, but for E&amp;M, you need SR at <em>any</em> speed.</p>
</div>
<p>So which is it?  Magnetic or Electric?  The answer is both and
neither!  We are heading toward an understanding that there is just
one “thing” that we currently call an electromagnetic field, and
whether we <em>name</em> it “electric” or “magnetic” depends on which
reference frame you’re observing in.  If SR had been developed before
magnetism was discovered, we probably wouldn’t even have a word for
“magnetic field” – there would just be result of transforming an
electric field into another reference frame.  Just like we now talk
about “spacetime”, and the space and time parts get mixed up when you
change frames, and just like how <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> get mixed up when you
rotate your coordinates around the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> axis, it seems that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{E}\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{B}\)</span> get mixed up when you switch reference frames, too.</p>
<p>But we can’t just make a four vector out of them!  They have six
components, not four.  To understand how to fold <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> into the
SR formalism, we must first figure out how they transform when you
switch frames.  Then we can see if and how the Lorentz transformation
is relevant to them.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="how-the-fields-transform">
<h2>How the Fields Transform<a class="headerlink" href="#how-the-fields-transform" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The goal for this section is to develop a model for how electric and
magnetic fields will change when we switch to another frame of
reference, moving with a velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_R\)</span> along the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> axis.  Once
we have that set of transformations, we can connect them to the
Lorentz transformations we already know, and thereby construct an
equation that will let us predict how <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{B}\)</span> will
change.  This will bring electric and magnetic fields into the SR
formalism.</p>
<p>The most important concept to remember going into this analysis is
that fields are not independently existing entities.  Fields are
a way of keeping track of where the charges are.  You can’t have a
field just existing, by itself, with no charges.  If you have a
field <em>here</em>, there must be charges <em>somewhere</em> that are causing
that field.  If you can figure out what happens to the charges,
you can figure out how the fields will change.</p>
<p>The second thing you need to remember is that all the rules for
figuring out fields, like calculating the flux through a Gaussian
surface and connecting that to the charge inside, or calculating the
line integral of an Amperian loop and connecting that to the current
flowing through the loop – all those rules still work in any
reference frame.  Remember the first postulate: the laws of physics
will be the same in any reference frame.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we can start constructing rules for how to get the
fields in a relatively moving reference frame, if we know the
situation in different reference frame.  Let’s start with the simplest
situation: a uniform electric field in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> direction.  What kind
of charge distribution will give us a uniform <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{E}\)</span> in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>
direction?  Well, set up a parallel plate capacitor such that the
plates are parallel to the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(yz\)</span> plane, and you will get a roughly
uniform field between the plates, perpendicular to them, which is
indeed the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> direction.  The magnitude of the field is the charge
density on the plates divided by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>How will this situation change if we switch into a passing reference
frame?  Well, any time interval would dilate, but this is a static
situation, so there are no relevant time intervals.  Any length along
the direction of the relative velocity will contract, so the distance
between the plates will get smaller, but the value of the field does
not depend on the distance between the plates.  The density of charge
on the plates will not change, so the field will not change.  Therefore</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-extrans">
<span class="eqno">(185)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-extrans" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\boxed{
E'_x = E_x
}\]</div>
<p>How about a uniform magnetic field?  The way to get a uniform magnetic
field is to have a current-carrying solenoid.  Then you will get a
nearly uniform field inside the coil with a value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu_0 n I\)</span>,
pointed along the axis of the solenoid, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> is the number of
coils per length.  Orient the solenoid so that the axis of the coil
is along the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> axis.  Now when we switch to a passing reference frame,
the length along the axis of the coil will contract!  So the number
of coils per length will increase: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n' = \gamma n\)</span>.  So you might think
the magnetic field will increase.  But wait!  This situation is not
static!  There is a current moving, and current is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dq/dt\)</span>, so there
is also a relevant time interval, which will dilate by the same factor
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span>!  So the current will go down by the same factor that the
coil density goes up, the two factors of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> will cancel each
other out, and the magnetic field will remain unchanged:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-bxtrans">
<span class="eqno">(186)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-bxtrans" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\boxed{
B'_x = B_x
}\]</div>
<p>Now things get a little more complicated.  If we want to get the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span>
field components in the perpendicular directions, we can keep the same
parallel plate capacitor, but we have to rotate it so that the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span>
field now points, say, up along the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> axis.  The plates of the
capacitor are now parallel to the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(xz\)</span> plane.  When we switch into
another reference frame, the dimension that contracts is along one
dimension of the plates, so the charge density will increase: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma'
= \gamma \sigma\)</span>.  This means the magnitude of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_y\)</span> will also
increase to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma E_y\)</span>.</p>
<p>But wait!  In this new primed reference frame, the plates will be
moving in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-x\)</span> direction!  That means in this reference frame,
there will be a current that wasn’t there in the unprimed frame, and
that means there will be a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> field in this reference frame that
wasn’t there in the unprimed frame!  If you draw a square Amperian
loop with side <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span>, lying in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(yz\)</span> plane, and place it so that one
side of it runs along the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> axis and the opposite side is outside
the capacitor, then there will be a current of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma' v_R L\)</span> that
runs through that square.  The loop integral around that square will
be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_z L\)</span>, so there will be a magentic field of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu_0 \sigma' v_R\)</span>
in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-z\)</span> direction.  We can write this in terms of the original
unprimed variables by putting in a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span>: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B'_z = -\mu_0 \gamma
\sigma v_R\)</span>.  An interactive animation of this situation is shown
in <a class="reference internal" href="#slideplatefig"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 18</span></a>, where you can change the relative
velocity of the frames and see how the fields change.</p>

<p>This means we really picked a special case when we first chose our
rotated capacitor at rest – we chose the only frame where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_z = 0\)</span>.
To get a general rule for how <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> transform, we should have
chosen a frame in which the capacitor was already moving, and then
transformed into a frame where the capacitor is moving at a different
speed.  Then we will have a general rule for how <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_y\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_z\)</span>
transform.  So let’s consider the primed frame we just derived as the
unprimed frame, and transfer to a different primed frame.  Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_R\)</span>
be the relative velocity between these two frames, and say the
unprimed frame is moving with a velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u\)</span>, relative to the frame
where the capacitor is at rest (which means there is a Lorentz factor
of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma_u=1/\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}\)</span> between the unprimed frame and the
rest frame).  In that case, the fields in the unprimed frame will be</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eyunp">
<span class="eqno">(187)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eyunp" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\vec{E} = \gamma_u \sigma_0 /\epsilon_0\hat{y}\]</div>

<p>We now want to switch into a reference frame that is moving at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_R\)</span>
relative to this new unprimed frame.  We will also need to relate
the primed reference frame back to the rest frame, so note that</p>

<p>is the speed of the primed frame relative to the rest frame, and
we will need a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma' = 1/\sqrt{1-v'^2/c^2}\)</span>.  This means that
the charge density on the plates will be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma' = \gamma'\sigma_0\)</span>
in the new primed frame.  If we were an observer living in this
new primed frame, we would say there was an electric field of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{E}' = \hat{y}\sigma'/\epsilon_0\)</span> and a magnetic field of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{B}' = -\hat{z}\mu_0 \sigma' v'\)</span>.  Our goal is to write
these field equations, as defined in the primed frame, in terms
of the quantities an observer in the unprimed frame would measure.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the electric field first.  We know that the charge
density in the unprimed frame is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma = \gamma_u \sigma_0\)</span>.  And we
know <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma' = \gamma' \sigma_0\)</span>.  Therefore, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma' = \sigma

factor of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1-u^2)\)</span> will cancel!  That leaves (putting the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span>s back)</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-lorfacrat">

<p>but <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/c^2=\mu_0\epsilon_0\)</span>, so if we multiply through the parentheses, we get</p>

<p>But those equations contain the formulae for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_y\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_z\)</span> in the unprimed frame!
So we end up with</p>

<p>So, much like we talked about with rotations, the electric and
magnetic fields are getting mixed up when you switch reference
frames. Also similar to the force on a charge moving next to a
current, what looks like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> in one frame has <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> mixed
together in another frame.</p>
<p>We can follow a similar process with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B'_z\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[B'_z = -\mu_0 \sigma' v' = -\mu_0 \sigma 
\frac{\gamma'}{\gamma_u} \frac{v_R+u}{1+v_Ru/c^2}

\gamma_R(1+v_Ru/c^2) \frac{v_R+u}{1+v_Ru/c^2}\]</div>
<p>using Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-lorfacrat">(193)</a> to get rid of the ratios of gammas.
There is a common factor in both numerator and denominator that will
cancel!</p>

<p>The second term is just the original <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_z\)</span> times a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma_R\)</span> factor,
and the first term depends on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span>, which we know is proportional to
the original <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_y\)</span>, so we can plug in the formulae for the fields to get</p>

<p>To make sure you have understood the logic, here, you should rotate
the capacitor and work out the last two components yourself.  If you
rotate the capacitor so that the plates lie parallel to the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(xy\)</span>
plane, then you’ll get <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_z\)</span>, and the motion of the capacitor in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>
will make a magnetic field in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+B_y\)</span> direction.  Once you convince
yourself of that, the rest of the math is exactly the same, just
substituting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_z\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_y\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+B_y\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-B_z\)</span>.  You should get</p>

<p>All right, that tells us how all three components of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{B}\)</span> will change when you switch to a relatively moving reference
frame.  Now what do we <em>do</em> with them, and how does this relate to the
Lorentz transformation we have used for such a change up to this
point?</p>
</section>
<section id="example">
<h2>Example<a class="headerlink" href="#example" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Let’s think through a possible experiment that one could (in principle)
do that would reveal why <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> have to transform like this.  A full
solution of this problem is beyond the scope of this course, but we can
work through the problem at a conceptual level.</p>
<p>You will have learned that a charged particle like an electron in the
presence of a magnetic field will move in a circle perpendicular
to the field.  The faster it goes, the wider the circle, and the stronger
the field, the smaller the circle.  Consider a cart that is carrying an
apparatus, like a solenoid or a Helmholtz coil, that can make a vertical
magentic field.  An electron travels horizontally into the field region,
and will start flying in a horizontal circle.  There is no electric field
in this reference frame.  All seems well (ignoring gravity, of course).</p>
<p>However, what if we start pushing the cart at a <em>very</em> slow speed
(nm/s, if you like.  Really slow.) along the ground.  If you didn’t
know relativity, you would think, there’s no reason for the electron
to change its motion.  The field is uniform, the electron just keeps
going in a circle – what the cart does has nothing to do with it.  So
you would expect the cart to just move slowly along until it moves out
from under the electron, at which point the electron is outside the
field, and it will shoot off into space.</p>
<p>However, now consider this situation from the reference frame where
the cart is at rest.  According to our postulates, if the cart moves
out from under the electron in the lab frame, the electron would have
to drift off the cart in the cart frame.  However, in the cart frame,
nothing is moving – it’s exactly the same as the original lab frame
when the cart was at rest.  So there is absolutely no reason why the
electron would start drifting off the cart at all, let alone why
should the electron pick that direction to drift?  If nothing is
moving in this frame, there is no reason for the electron to move in
any particular direction.</p>
<p>What is the resolution of this paradox?  Now that you know how the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> fields transform, you will understand that when you switch
reference frames from the frame where the cart is at rest (vertical <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{B}
= B_y\hat{y}\)</span>,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E=0\)</span>) to a frame where the cart is moving, there will be a field in
the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> direction in the new frame (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E'_z = \gamma_Rv_RBy\)</span>), in addition
to the altered value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B'_y = \gamma_R B_y\)</span>).  Although
solving the equations of motion under these primed fields is beyond
the scope of this book, the solution is a shape much like the path
of a point on the wheel of a bike – the electron will keep up with
the cart in the frame where the cart is moving.  It not fall off the
edge of the cart in either frame.</p>
<p>You can’t resolve this paradox without relativity, and the speeds
involved are obviously nowhere even close to the speed of light.</p>

<h2>The Electromagnetic Field Tensor<a class="headerlink" href="#the-electromagnetic-field-tensor" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>For the rest of this book up to this point, when we wanted to see
what would happen to some quantity when measured in a reference
frame in relative motion, we cast the quantity in question as a
four-vector and performed a Lorentz transformation.  We can’t do that,
here, because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{B}\)</span> together have six components,
which don’t easily fit into a four-vector.  We need some way to
deal with these fields, and we need to <em>use</em> the Lorentz transformation,
because the success of all those four vectors shows us that the Lorentz
matrix is indeed the correct way to switch reference frames.</p>
<p>Before we start working toward a solution, let me copy all the relevant
equations here so we have them in one place:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[E'_x = E_x\hspace{3cm}B'_x = B_x\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[E'_y = \gamma_R E_y  - \gamma_Rv_RB_z\hspace{3cm}
B'_y = \gamma_R B_y + \gamma_R \frac{v_R}{c^2}E_z\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[E'_z = \gamma_R E_z  + \gamma_Rv_RB_y\hspace{3cm}
B'_z = \gamma_R B_z - \gamma_R \frac{v_R}{c^2}E_y\]</div>
<p>and recall that the Lorentz matrix can be written as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-lormate">
<span class="eqno">(201)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-lormate" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\begin{split}\Lambda^\alpha_\beta =
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_R &amp; -\gamma_R\beta_R &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
-\gamma_R\beta_R &amp; \gamma_R &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Note now I have switched to using Einstein notation and have left out
the complex number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>.  The letter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> refers to the row number
of the matrix, and the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> refers to the column number (0 through
3, of course).   So <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Lambda^0_1 = -\gamma_R\beta_R\)</span>
(first row, second column).</p>
<p>At this point, many books jump to the answer and show that it works.
While there is nothing formally wrong with that, it’s not very
emotionally satisfying.  I’d like to give you some kind of intuition
as to why you might want to make that jump, rather than just tell you
the answer.  In no way is what I am about to do any kind of
<em>derivation</em>; what I want to do is give you a kind of guide to get you
to the answer, not a proof.</p>
<p>We have six numbers (two vectors) and a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\times 4\)</span> matrix that we
think must be involved with the transfer somehow.  If there were a
simple way to put each three vector into a four-vector, you might
think that maybe the thing to do would be to perform <em>two</em> Lorentz
transformations: one for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> and one for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>.  However, we need to
make the dimensions match up.  You can’t multiply a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\times 4\)</span> matrix
by a three-row column.</p>
<p>If it were as simple as performing two Lorentz transformations, you
would write that as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-twolormat">
<span class="eqno">(202)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-twolormat" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\Lambda^\alpha_\beta\Lambda^\mu_\nu\]</div>
<p>where the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span> refer to the rows and the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span> refer to the columns.</p>
<p>This short equation represents multiplying two <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\times 4\)</span> matrices
together.  That’s going across each row and down each column 16 times,
and what you end up with is another <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\times 4\)</span> matrix.  But that gives
a clue.  Maybe what we need to do is fit the six field components into
a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\times 4\)</span> matrix somehow.  If we could do that, then we could
multiply these two Lorentz matrices by that field matrix, and the
result would be <em>another</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\times 4\)</span> matrix, which we could interpret
as the values of the same matrix, just in the new relative reference frame.
Mathematically, that would be</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-twotransforms">
<span class="eqno">(203)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-twotransforms" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[F'^{\alpha\mu} = \Lambda^\alpha_\beta\Lambda^\mu_\nu F^{\beta\nu}\]</div>
<p>The Einstein notation means that this equation is really representing
sixteen equations, one for each term in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\times 4\)</span> matrix that
results from all these multiplications.  There’s a double sum over
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span>, leaving single values for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>
unchanged from the right side to the left.  So a single one of these
sixteen terms would look like</p>

<p>You have to think about Einstein notation like writing a computer
program: once you assign <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> a particular value, like
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span>, then that value has to go in everywhere that there’s an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>.
So you can see in Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-oneofsixteen">(204)</a> that there’s a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>
in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span> location, so everywhere in the huge sum where there
would be a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>, there’s a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> in each of those locations (the
superscript on the second <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Lambda\)</span>).  The lower index on the
second <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Lambda\)</span> is always the second number in the superscript
on the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span>, because those positions both have a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span> in Equation
<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-twotransforms">(203)</a>.</p>
<p>Now, this looks like a huge mess, but luckily for us, most of
the numbers in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Lambda\)</span> matrix (Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-lormate">(201)</a>) are
zero!  All the examples of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Lambda\)</span> elements in the specific
case of Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-oneofsixteen">(204)</a> are either in the first
or second row.  And the last two columns are both zeros!
If we plug in for the elements of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Lambda\)</span>, we get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-killzeros">
<span class="eqno">(205)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-killzeros" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[F'^{01} =

\beta_R^2\gamma_R^2 F^{10} 
-\gamma_R^2\beta_R F^{11} \]</div>
<p>Now, this looks a bit simpler.  The next clue is the fact that there’s
a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma_R^2 + \gamma_R^2\beta_R^2\)</span> in there.  If it were just
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma_R^2 - \gamma_R^2\beta_R^2\)</span>, that would just be <em>ONE</em>!!!  So,
what if (crazy thought), what if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^{01}=-F^{10}\)</span>?  Then the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> factors would disappear, and we’d just have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^{01}\)</span> in
there.</p>

-\gamma_R^2\beta_R (F^{00} + F^{11} )\]</div>
<p>Now, we know that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E'_x=E_x\)</span>, so this is starting to look like that.
What do with the last part, though?  Well, if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^{01}=-F^{10}\)</span>, that
suggests that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^{00}=0\)</span>, as that’s an example of something that is
equal to negative itself.  If the diagonal elements are all zero, and
the matrix as a whole is anti-symmetric, then our specific example of
Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-oneofsixteen">(204)</a> has just turned into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E'_x = E_x\)</span>!  Not
only that, but if the matrix is indeed anti-symmetric, then instead of
sixteen elements, you can discount the diagonal (because those four
are all zeros), which leaves twelve, and if half of them are equal and
opposite to the other half, we actually only have (drumroll) SIX!!!</p>
<p>We are trying to find a way to use six components of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{B}\)</span>, and we already showed that one of the elements of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^{\alpha\mu}\)</span> could well be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_x\)</span>, which suggests that the other
five remaining components of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^{\alpha\mu}\)</span> could well be the other
five components of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{B}\)</span>.</p>
<p>So let’s go back to Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-oneofsixteen">(204)</a> and rewrite it
to allow for an anti-symmetric matrix:</p>

<p>Let’s look at another example.  What about first row, third column?
If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^{01}\)</span> might be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_x\)</span>, maybe <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^{02}\)</span> is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_y\)</span>, and we know what

either way, but most people use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E/c\)</span> rather than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(cB\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>You can go through all four remaining elements of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^{\alpha\mu}\)</span> and
figure out that one way of writing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span> that will satisfy Equation
<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-twotransforms">(203)</a> is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-emtensorfin">
<span class="eqno">(211)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-emtensorfin" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\begin{split}F^{\alpha\mu} =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; E_x/c &amp; E_y/c &amp; E_z/c\\
-E_x/c &amp; 0 &amp; B_z &amp; -B_y\\
-E_y/c &amp; -B_z &amp; 0 &amp; B_x\\
-E_z/c &amp; B_y &amp; -B_x &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>You can (and should) check that you will reproduce the the other four
of the six transform equations summarized at the top of this section
if you plug this matrix into Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-twotransforms">(203)</a>.  This object
is called “the electromagnetic field tensor”, and it combines both
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{B}\)</span> into a single object, much like how <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\vec{x}\)</span>
combines <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dy\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dz\)</span> into a single object.</p>
<p>Now, I pulled a fast one on you.  When I hit Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-antisym">(206)</a>, I
said “well, gosh, we want <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_x\)</span> to stay the same, so this might be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_x\)</span>!”.
But if you were paying attention, you might have noticed that the entire
sequence of logic following that point could flow just as well if we started
from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B'_x=B_x\)</span> instead of going to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_x\)</span> first!  If you start with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B_x\)</span>,
you would construct the following matrix:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-dualtensorfin">
<span class="eqno">(212)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-dualtensorfin" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\begin{split}G^{\alpha\mu} =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; B_x &amp; B_y &amp; B_z\\
-B_x &amp; 0 &amp; -E_z/c &amp; E_y/c\\
-B_y &amp; E_z/c &amp; 0 &amp; -E_x/c\\
-B_z &amp; -E_y/c &amp; E_x/c &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>This is called the “dual tensor”, and it works <em>just as well</em> as the “regular”
EM field tensor.  It’s purely a matter of convention that we tend to use
the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span> rather than the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span>.  They both transform the same way when you switch
reference frames.  You will see both of these again in the next chapter.</p>

<section id="summary">
<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>You have seen in this chapter that it is possible to think of
magnetism as simply a manifestation of how space and time distort when
you switch into different reference frames.  Since all magnetic fields
are a mechanism of keeping track of <em>moving</em> charges, just as electric
fields are a way of keeping track of charges’ locations, motion is an
intrinsic part of what we think of as magnetism, and therefore
relativity theory is critically important to understand what’s going
on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we made no assumptions whatsoever about how big the
speeds involved are.  For mechanics, you don’t need to worry about
relativity, but with E&amp;M, there is no such restriction.  The
effects of Lorentz transformations show up at any speeds.</p>
<p>This in turn suggests that what we call “electric” fields and what we
call “magnetic” fields are not independent, separate concepts.  By
switching reference frames, they get “mixed up”, just like space and
time do when you change reference frames.  The components of what we
call <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{E}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\vec{B}\)</span> are just whatever numbers fall into the
appropriate slots of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^{\alpha\mu}\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G^{\alpha\mu}\)</span>.  Nature does
not make a distinction between the two – it’s our own interpretation
of the application.  There is only one thing that is better called
“elecromagnetic field tensor”, much like there is only one thing that
we call “spacetime”.  The perception that these are separate things
are an artefact of the limits of human senses, and it took the hard
work and genius of people like Einstein, Lorentz, Minkowski, and
others to climb outside those limitations and perceive how the
universe works on its own.</p>
