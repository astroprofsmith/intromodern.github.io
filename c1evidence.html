<h1>Chapter 1:  Roots of Relativity<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-1-roots-of-relativity" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Before we dive into the set of predictions and interpretations that
make up what we call “Special Relativity” (or SR), it’s important to
lay some groundwork and establish the definitions for what we will be
talking about.  Much of SR will twist and challenge what you thought
you knew about space and time, so it is important to define our terms
carefully and precisely, or else it can get very confusing as to what
we are actually talking about.  In the first two chapters, we will
describe the rules by which the game of SR is played, and describe
some of the reasons why those rules have been accepted.  It’s
important to know, right from the beginning, that the predictions of
relativity, in both the general and specific forms, have passed every
single test to which they have been subjected.  As far as we can tell,
the universe really does work this way.</p>
<p>After a few notes about the electronic format of this book, the rest
of this chapter will present the experimental evidence that convinced
the scientific world to take Einstein’s proposals seriously.  Chapter
two will lay out the remarkably few premises that are needed to
develop all the challenging interpretations of space, time, and motion
that we think of as “relativity”.</p>

<h2>A Few Notes about this eBook<a class="headerlink" href="#a-few-notes-about-this-ebook" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This electronic book is an adaptation and expansion by Don Smith of a
printed text written by Rex Adelberger before he passed.  By casting
the book in this electronic format, it is possible to create animated
and interactive graphical representations of concepts that were only
static images in the original text.  These interactive graphs have
been produced using the VPython library on the WebVPython web site.
As with all VPython visualizations, you can zoom, pan, and rotate the
animation however you like, using the tools of your particular
device’s interface (be it a smartphone, tablet, or trackpad).
Interactive elements such as buttons and sliders are explained in
the caption for each such figure.  Most static graphs are created
by Python code embedded in the book, rather than imported as images
created by separate analysis software.</p>
<p>This book is aimed at an audience of students that have completed at
least a year of introductory Physics and are comfortable with the
mathematics of calculus as well as vector and matrix manipulation.  I
will assume the reader is familiar with the relationships between
displacement, velocity, acceleration, momentum, and force, as defined
in classical Physics, as well as the classical properties of electric
and magnetic fields.  The Pythagorean Theorem is ubiquitous, although
the reader will see that it works a little differently when time is
incorporated as a fourth dimension.</p>

<h2>Experimental Foundation<a class="headerlink" href="#experimental-foundation" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Before the 1900s, a popular theory about the propagation of light
waves was that they traveled in some medium called the “ether”. The
‘ether’ plays the analogous role that the air plays in the propagation
of sound. The physical properties of the air determine the speed of
the sound waves. In the case of the ‘ether’, it supported a speed of
propagation of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.0 \times 10^8\)</span> m/s. Following the usual practices of
physics, the validity of this theory would be determined by
experiments. As a test of this theory, in 1881, Michelson did an
experiment to measure the relative velocity of the ether with respect
to the earth. The ‘best’ ether theory of the time suggested that the
ether was at rest with respect to the fixed stars. The earth orbits
the sun once a year at an orbital speed of about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.0 \times 10^4\)</span>
m/s.  If a light beam on earth travels in the same direction as the
orbital motion about the sun, then that beam of light is in a frame of
reference that is moving at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.0 \times 10^4\)</span> m/s with respect to the
speed of the ether. If the beam of light is heading towards the sun,
it is moving in a frame of reference that is at respect to the ether.</p>
<p>Michelson designed an interferometer (schematically shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#michelfig"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 1</span></a>) that used partially silvered mirrors to split a
beam of light into two legs that were at right angles to each
other. By careful examination of the interference of the light after
it traveled along the two beam lines and was recombined by the
partially silvered mirrors, he could measure a difference in speed of
light in the two arms of about 300 m/s, much smaller than the orbital
speed of the earth about the sun. The interferometer was floated on a
pot of mercury and allowed to rotate slowly. During a rotation of 360
degrees, at one time one of the legs would be pointing in the
direction of motion of the earth (moving with respect to the ether)
and the other at rest with respect to the ether. A quarter of a turn
later, the light in the arm that was at rest with respect to the ether
would be moving and vice versa. This anticipated change in the speed
of light when the either was at rest with respect to the mirrors or
moving with respect to the mirrors in the other arm could be detected
in the changing of the interference pattern of the combined beams.</p>
<p>Much to Michelson’s surprise, he measured no difference in speed as
the arm was at rest with respect to the ether or moving with respect
to the ether. Michelson had this terse description of the experiment:
“The interpretation of these results is that there is no displacement
of the interference bands. … The result of the hypothesis of a
stationary ether is thus shown to be incorrect.” (A. A. Michelson,
Am. J. Sci, 122, 120 (1881)).  Michelson was encouraged by some
important English physicists to continue his research. Along with
E.W. Morley, he built a much bigger interferometer that had multiple
mirrors and was 10 times as sensitive to the relative motion. He could
measure a relative velocity of 30 m/s. Again, they found no
difference in the speed in the two arms. (A. A. Michelson and
E. W. Morley, Am. J. Sci., 134, 333 (1887)). The experiment was
repeated often over the next few years, at even greater precision, but
always gave the same null result: there is no stationary ether. As a
consequence of his careful and brilliant work about the nature of the
propagation of light, Michelson was awarded the Nobel prize in 1907.</p>
<p>As with most interesting experiments, Michelson got a result that did
not agree with his intuition about the outcome of the
experiment. After a number of very bright physicists examined these
results, a relatively simple and rather clever model was developed
that agreed with the experimental results.</p>

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 1 </span><span class="caption-text">Animation of a simplified schematic of a Michaelson
interferometer.  A laser, represented by the red cylinder to the left,
shines a beam to the right.  The light is split by a diagonal
half-silvered mirror.  Half the beam continues to the right, while
half the beam goes up.  Each of these half-beams is reflected from a
flat mirror back along the incoming path.  In the animation, the
reflected beam is shifted slightly toward the viewer – rotate the
image to see the difference clearly.  The reflected beams then
recombine at the splitter, resulting in an outgoing downward beam that
is the sum of the two beams.  The animation begins in a world with no
ether.  If you click on the checkbox below the animation, you can turn
on an ether, and the slider will rotate the direction of the relative
motion between the ether and the apparatus.  Waves going with the
ether are stretched out, while waves heading upstream are squished.  By
rotating the direction, you can see that the outgoing beam varies
dramatically based on the angle.  No such dependence was ever
observed.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#michelfig" title="Permalink to this image">#</a></p>

comes from observations of binary star systems.  If two stars,
orbiting each other, lie in a plane that is shared with the Earth,
then we will observe eclipses every half orbit, as one star blocks at
least some of the light from the other.  Half of each orbit, one star
is moving toward the Earth, and the other is moving away.</p>
<p>If the speed of light depended on the relative speed of the emitter
and/or the receiver, the light from the star approaching the Earth
would be moving faster than the light from the receeding star.  Over
the years of travel between the stars and the Earth, the faster light
would catch up to the slower light, perhaps even overtaking it.  The
observations of the moments in the orbit, such as one star passing in
front of the other, would arrive at the Earth at completely distorted
times.  A simulation of such a distortion is shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#nonsrlc"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2</span></a>.</p>
<p>Of course, no such distortion has ever been observed.  Eclipses arrive
like clockwork.  Arrival times of the eclipses’ beginnings and endings
might need to be corrected for the Earth’s motion around the Sun
(light will take up to sixteen minutes longer to arrive at the Earth
when it is on the far side of the Sun from the star), but there is no
evidence that some of the light from the stars is getting here faster
than other light.</p>

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 2 </span><span class="caption-text">Simulation of a simplified binary star system light curve.
One star is three times as bright as the other.  This light curve
shows two cycles of the stars’ orbit as seen from Earth, 100 light
years away.  The deeper eclipse is when the brighter star’s light is
blocked by the dimmer star.  The upper figure uses a constant speed of
light for all photons, while the lower figure shows what such a light
curve might look like if the light from the approaching star moved
faster than the light from the receeding star (the speed of the stars
has been exaggerated to accentuate the effect).  The upper figure
matches what binary stars actually look like.  See, e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/senior/astrophysics/binary_types.html#bintypeeclipse">this example

<p>Once you accept the idea that the speed of light is the same
for all observers, many counter-intuitive results follow, but
all of them have been verified in the real world.</p>
