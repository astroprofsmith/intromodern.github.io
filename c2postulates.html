<h2>Two Postulates of Relativity<a class="headerlink" href="#two-postulates-of-relativity" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>All of relativity follows from two surprisingly simple postulates.
Once you accept these postulates, you can use the tools of mathematics
to derive predictions for how space and time will behave, and how
objects will move within them.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Another way to express this postulate is to assert that there is no
universally preferred, or absolute, reference frame.  If you are on a
train moving East, and I am on a train moving West, there is no
physical experiment we can perform that will tell us who is “really”
moving.  You might try to assert that while both trains are moving,
the ground is not, but of course, the Earth is spinning and orbiting a
star that is itself orbiting a galaxy that is drifting through the
universe.  The closest thing there is to a universal reference frame
is the reference frame of the cosmic microwave background radiation,
which permeates the whole universe as a record of that moment when
most of space became transparent about 14 billion years ago.  That’s a
very large system to choose as a reference, but the choice is
arbitrary.  There’s nothing about the universe that says even that
choice is more natural than any other.  Once you choose a reference
frame, any set of experiments or measurements you carry out will
follow the same set of rules as they would in any other reference
frame.  The answers could be different, but they wouldn’t be “more
right” or “more wrong” than measurements carried out in some other
inertial reference frame.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>The speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is the most surprising one, but as explained above, nature seems
to have forced this idea onto us.  No other speed behaves like this.
When someone walks forward on an airplane in flight, a fellow
passenger would perceive them as walking at a meter per second or so,
but someone on the ground would perceive them as moving at hundreds of
meters per second.  This seems obvious.  The premise that light from a
flashlight on an airplane would be measured as having the same speed
on the plane as from the ground seems absurd.  However, as explained
in Chapter 1, this is what actually does happen in nature.</p>

<section id="inertial-reference-frames-and-events">
<h2>Inertial Reference Frames and Events<a class="headerlink" href="#inertial-reference-frames-and-events" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The term “inertial reference frame” has come up several times already.
Before we go any further, we need to be very clear on what this term
means.  In essence, a “reference frame” refers to a single set of
space and time coordinates.  Pick an origin in space and time, and
then clock readings mark locations along a time axis, and ruler
readings mark locations along spacial axes, which usually are the
standard cartesian x, y, and z.  Four numbers can therefore define a
moment location in space at a moment in time, relative to the chosen
origin.</p>
<p>The difference between two ruler readings along an axis is
called a displacement (if the two points in question are not along the
same axis, we must use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the amount of
displacement along the diagonal, or we can express the total
displacement as a vector with a displaceent along each axis).  The
difference between two clock readings is called a time interval or a
duration.  If you consider smaller and smaller durations and
displacements, the region described by these numbers will shrink to be
a mathematical point in space and an instantaneous moment in time.
This is sometimes represented as a finger snap or a lightning flash,
although in reality neither of those actions are infinitesimal in
extent.  An infinitesimal chunk of space and time is called an
“event”.  The total collection of all events is considered to be
“reality”.</p>
<p>If reality is the collection of all events that happen throughout
space and time, the question that concerns us in this course on
Special Relativity is how these events are measured by different
observers in relative motion.  We need to be a bit more specific about
what it means to establish a system of coordinates in space and time.
Typically by the time you reach the age at which you are reading this
book, you will already take for granted the idea that space and time
are a kind of fixed lattice underlying reality as we know it, and that
locations in space and time have an absolute meaning independent of
who is trying to measure them.  One of the goals of this book is to
convince you this intuitive picture does not actually match reality.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must be more specific about what these four numbers are
and how they might be measured.  The typical image that is called
forth to represent this process is a lattice of rulers and clocks.
Imagine you had an infinite number of clocks and also an infinite
number of rulers.  You painstakingly synchronize all these clocks, and
confirm that the rulers are all not different in length.  Now, you
very slowly move the clocks out through space, putting one at the end
of each ruler, and then extending the rulers out from each placed
clock, so that in the end, you have a lattice of cubes made by the
rulers, with a clock at each vertex.  The location of each clock is
therefore the number of rulers in each direction from the origin, and
each clock has a reading, based on the overall synchronization.  A
single event, therefore, can be recorded as happening at the nearest
clock (as long as these rulers are imaginary, we can imagine them
being as small as we need them to be to achieve the desired spacial
resolution), marked at that clock reading: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>.
Those numbers can be collected after the events by bringing the clocks
back together and collating their readings.</p>
<p>This concept of an infinite lattice of synchronized clocks represents
our idea of a “reference frame”.  As long as we are imagining an
infinite lattice, we can imagine a second infinite lattice (or a
third, or as many as we like) that is passing through the first,
moving at a constant relative velocity.  This velocity could be
measured by recording when certain clocks pass each other, and when
the clocks are gathered up again later, the number of rulers traveled
divided by the durations on the relevant clocks would reveal the
relative velocity, which we will designate as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_R\)</span>.  For special
relativity, we require that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_R\)</span> be constant.  Figure 2.1 shows an
animated representation of two reference frames in relative motion,
although you have to imagine the lattice of rulers and clocks
extending off to infinity.</p>

<p>Figure 2.1 – Animation of two reference frames in relative motion.
The spheres represent clocks, and the rods represent rulers.  The viewer
must imagine that the lattice continues on indefinitely an all directions.
The camera is at rest with respect to the reference frame colored red,
while the blue frame is in constant relative motion.  The animation will
loop, to represent more clocks and rods coming in from the side.</p>
</div>
<p>Ultimately, we are interested in how objects in the universe move and
interact with each other.  To study this motion, we need to make
measurements of location and duration, which needs to happen within a
chosen reference frame.  Measurements recorded in different reference
frame will be compared, but they should never be mixed together.  A
displacement measure in one reference frame divided by a duration
measured in another reference frame would not represent a real
velocity.  An object could be at rest (velocity of zero) in one
reference frame, but to observers recording in a second reference
frame, moving at a relative velocity to the first, the object would be
recorded in different places at different times.  In other words, to
the observers at rest with respect to the second reference frame, the
object and the lattice of rulers and clocks with it would be moving,
not their own lattice of rulers and clocks.</p>
<p>Another important assumption we must make about the reference frames
we consider in special relativity is that they be “inertial frames”.
What this means, simply expressed, is that Newton’s laws are accurate
when objects are observed within the frame.  Objects’ velocities do
not change unless a force acts upon them, momentum and energy are
conserved, and so forth.  An example of a non-inertial reference frame
would be if you put the reference frame lattice on a carousel.  Using
this rotating lattice of rulers and clocks, objects could be observed
to move in complicated, changing patterns, without any observable
forces causing the changes in motion (so we make up fictitious forces
and call them names like “centrifugal” to make Newton’s laws keep
working).  The rules of special relativity only work in inertial
reference frames.  Usually, but not always, this means reference
frames that have constant velocity, including zero.</p>

<h2>Important Correlaries to the Postulates<a class="headerlink" href="#important-correlaries-to-the-postulates" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Nothing physical can travel faster than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span>.  We will see why in later
chapters of this book, but it’s important to be aware of that from the
beginning.  Once you demand that a speed be the same in all reference
frames, as the first postulate does, the universe will conspire to
make sure nothing moves faster than that.  It’s important to note that
we call this speed “the speed of light”, but that’s because light,
having no inertial mass, moves at the fastest speed possible.  Light
will slow down in materials like water or glass, so if we’re being
careful, we should call this speed “the speed of light in a vacuum”.
But really, it’s the speed light moves in a vacuum simply because
that’s the fastest speed the universe allows.  Anything with no
inertial mass will move at that speed (the particles called neutrinos
also have almost no mass, and they move that fast, too).  So it is not
possible for anything to move from one place to another faster than
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<p>For precisely that reason, you can’t “just know” what’s happening at
some other location than your own.  It takes time for anything, anything
that might convey information or have an effect, to move.  Even when
you look across the room, you are seeing the room as it was a few
nanoseconds ago.  The Moon you see in the sky is the Moon as it was
about a second ago.  The Sun that shines on us is the Sun from eight
minutes ago.  We often describe physical situations as if we have an
instantaneous overview of everything everywhere all at once.  This is
impossible.  Even to measure the ends of an object with a ruler demands
either moving one’s self to the other side of the object, or sending a
light beam to the other side and back.  Many misunderstandings and
confusions in special relativity arise from people assuming they just
know what is going on at another location, without allowing for the
time it would take to get from one location to another.</p>
<p>Most of special relativity is about comparing measurements according
to two different reference frames that are in motion relative to each
other.  <em>Special</em> relativity demands the assumption that the relative
velocity between the frames is constant (a “special” case).  If the
motion of the reference frames is not constant, the theory must be
modified to a more general form, which makes it General Relativity.</p>
<p>Once you have two different reference frames, it is important to state
three characteristics that might seem self-evident, but they have
important implications that are worth articulating explicitly.  First,
imagine each frame of reference has a set of observers associated with
it, or acting within it.  Each set of observers has to agree that the
same events happened.  Switching reference frames does not change what
actually happens.  People in different reference frames may well
disagree on when and where events happen, but they should not disagree
on <em>whether</em> the events happen.</p>
<p>Second, each set of observers must agree on what the results of
measurements are.  Not only must there be agreement within the set of
observers within a particular reference frame, but each set of
observers must agree on what measurements are made in another
reference frame.  Those measurements might well contradict each other,
but all observers should agree on what they are.  For example, if a
set of observers in reference frame 1 agree that a room is 12 m
across, a set of observers in reference frame 2 should not be able to
truthfully assert that the first set of observers actually measured
the room to be 11 m across.  The second set of observers could
feasibly measure the room to be 11 m across, themselves, but they
should agree that the first set of observers measured 12 m.</p>
<p>All sets of observers should agree that causes come before effects.
We will find that switching reference frames will change many aspects
of space and time that you are used to thinking of as universal.
However, causes must still come before effects.  This is, as some have
suggested, a kind of definition of time.  As the old saying goes,
“Time… is what keeps everything from happening at once.”

<h2>Model to describe the experimental results.<a class="headerlink" href="#model-to-describe-the-experimental-results" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>One interpretation of Michelson’s experimental results is to say that
observers in any inertial reference frame will measure that light
travels at the same speed.   This is quite in contrast to how sound
moves through the air. If I am moving towards the source, the sound
seems to be traveling faster than when I am moving away from the
source of the sound.   If an inertial observer measures the speed of
the photons that come from a flashlight that she holds in her hand,
she would get the value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c = 3.0 \times 10^8\)</span> m/s. If a second
observer, moving at a speed of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.8 \times 10^8\)</span> runs away from (or
towards) the flash light would also measure the speed of the photons
emitted by that same flashlight to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span>, precisely the same value as
the other observer. This is intuitatively absurd, but it agrees with
the experiments, so it is a ‘not wrong’ model for the propagation of
light.</p>
<p>The next step in developing the model is to transform this literary
statement into mathematical terms so that quantitative predictions can
be made. Consider a point source emitting light waves in three
dimension. An observer would see the light waves traveling out in the
shape of a sphere whose radius is dependent of time (as seen in
Figure 2.2). As the light is emitted, in some very small
time interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt\)</span>, the wave front makes a spherical shape of radius
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = c dt\)</span>. The 3-dimensional equation for a spherical shape centered
at the origin is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eqsph">
<span class="eqno">(1)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eqsph" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[x^2+y^2+z^2= r^2\]</div>
<p>Using the distances represented by the arrows in Figure 2.2, equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eqsph">(1)</a> becomes:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eqsph2">
<span class="eqno">(2)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eqsph2" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[(dx)^2+(dy)^2+(dz)^2 = (cdt)^2,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dy\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dz\)</span> are how much the observer measured the wave
front to propagate during the time interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> is the speed
of light as measured by the observer.</p>
<p>Consider a second reference frame, which we designate “the primed
frame” (all variables measured in this frame will have a prime on
them, like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x^\prime\)</span>), traveling at a constant speed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v_R\)</span> in the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{x}\)</span> direction with respect to the first observer (the first
observer finds the source of the light flash to be at rest).  If this
second observer were to observe the same set of events (the wave front
of the light propagating away from the point source), what should she
see?</p>

<p>Common sense says that the wave front should not longer seem to be
spherical, but should appear to be oblate (a squashed
sphere). However, what Michelson found was that this spherical wave
had to look the same to this observer as it appeared to the first
observer. Otherwise, the second observer would measure a different
velocity for the light wave. What the observer in the primed reference
frame measures is a spherical wave that propagates outward at the same
speed as shown in Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eqsph">(1)</a>!. The second (primed) observer
also sees a spherical wave, but this time the observer measures:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eqsphp">
<span class="eqno">(3)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eqsphp" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[(dx^\prime)^2 + (dy^\prime)^2 + (dz^\prime)^2 = (c dt^\prime)^2\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx^\prime\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dy^\prime\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dz^\prime\)</span> are how much the
second observer measured the wave front to propagate in time
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt^\prime\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> (not <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c^\prime\)</span>!) is the speed of light.</p>
<p>Equations <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eqsph2">(2)</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eqsphp">(3)</a> can be combined to be:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-cfbb695a-0064-4515-9da4-371cb88a69a1">
<span class="eqno">(4)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-cfbb695a-0064-4515-9da4-371cb88a69a1" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\begin{equation}
(dx)^2+(dy)^2+(dz)^2 - (cdt)^2 = (dx^\prime)^2 + (dy^\prime)^2 + (dz^\prime)^2 - (c dt^\prime)^2
\end{equation}\]</div>
<p>It appears that there is a sum of squares of measured displacements
and time intervals for the measurement of the propagation of the wave
front of a light wave that are the same for each of the two observers
(moving with respect to each other) that remains constant. This
statement can be written as a conservation law. The sum:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-778f2621-05f9-448e-bc08-7bfff30b5f77">
<span class="eqno">(5)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-778f2621-05f9-448e-bc08-7bfff30b5f77" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\begin{equation}
(dx^\prime)^2 + (dy^\prime)^2 + (dz^\prime)^2 - (c dt^\prime)^2 
\end{equation}\]</div>
<p>must remain constant. This conservation law is quite different from
what Newton and company thought was ‘conserved’ in the measurement of
the motion of an thing. In the Newtonian world, the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt\)</span>
would be the same for both observers, implying a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c^\prime \neq c\)</span>,
not this strange looking sum. But, if this model agrees with the
experiments, it is not wrong; even if it disagrees with Newton’s
model.</p>
