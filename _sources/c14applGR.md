# Chapter 14: Some Applications of General Relativity

## Mercury's Orbit

General Relativity demands a complete reconceptualization of how
gravity works.   Why go to so much effort?  What about Newtonian
gravity is so inadequate as to merit such a radical move?  Well,
as successful as Newton's gravity was, it was not without its
critics.  Leibnitz, for example, was never satisfied that Newton
provided no mechanism by which two objects in space might exert
forces on each other.  How does the Earth "know" where the Sun
is, that it should be pulled in the right direction?  Leibnitz
suggested the intervening space might be filled with some kind of
vortices to mediate the interaction, but such vortices were never
found, and the success of Newtonian gravity in mapping the orbits
of the comets and planets convinced everyone of its utility.

In fact, in the mid-19th century, Newtonian calculations were
successful in predicting the location of a new planet that no one
hitherto had known was there.  Careful measurements of the movement of
Uranus showed that it was not following the predictions of Newtonian
calculations, unless there was an unknown object out there exerting
forces on it that were not being accounted for.  Laborious
calculations from two different people, independently, predicted where
this unknown object should be, and the planet Neptune was discovered
in a location consistent with their predictions.

```{note}
Although German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle is rightly credited
with discovering Neptune in 1846, he is actually not the first person to
*observe* the planet.  That honor goes to none other than Galileo
Galilei, who in 1612 was tracking the movement of the moons of Jupiter.

The dotted line leads to a nearby star that Galileo was using as a
reference, but back extrapolation shows that this "star" was actually,
unbeknownst to anyone at the time, the planet Neptune!
