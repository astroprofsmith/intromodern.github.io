# Chapter 5: Properties of Spacetime Diagrams

Now that we have the tools of the displacement four vector, the
spacetime diagram, and the Lorentz transformation, it is worth taking
some time to look at what we can learn about the properties of space
and time by applying these tools to the spacetime diagram.

## Types of Intervals

I need my notebook to work on this one.
