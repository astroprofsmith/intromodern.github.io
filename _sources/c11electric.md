# Chapter 11: The Electromagnetic Tensor

Many introductory relativity textbooks stop with dynamics, but I think
it's important to include some of the implications of realtivity
theory for the understanding of electricity and magnetism.  There are
two reasons why it's important to see how SR affects E&M: first, for
mechanics, the effects of relativity are completely negligible in our
world of physics professors and dump trucks.  The weird effects only show
up at speeds near the speed of light, and for most day-to-day processes
you can blissfully ignore them.

Within the context of electricity, however, relativistic effects
occur, and are important, at *any* speed.  Even for the literal
snail's pace of the average drift speed of a 1 A current in a copper
wire, the differing observations in reference frames in relative
motion are obvious and unavoidable.

Second, the theory of electrodynamics that culminates in Maxwell's
Equations is automatically consistent with SR.  Newtonian mechanics
needs massive modifications to work with SR, but the bulk of
relativistic E&M is learning how to write it in four-vector notation
and remarking, "Wow!  It works!"  For a full treatment of this topic,
I recommend an advanced electrodynamics book such as Griffiths.  In
this eBook, I only plan to introduce the subject, not explore all the
implications.

## Magnetic Force as a Relativistic Effect

Before we dive into tackling how relativity implies we must rethink
E&M, let's first walk through a classical understanding of a simple
problem.  Then we will recast that problem through a relativistic lens
and see how it invites a different understanding of the phenomenon.
We will start with the force on an electric charge moving parallel to
a current-carrying wire.
