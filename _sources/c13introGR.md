# Chapter 13: Concepts of General Relativity

Although a full treatment of General Relativity is far beyond the
scope of this book, I would like to leave you with some hints at
the major concepts you must grapple with, if you extend the theory

## The Twin Paradox Revisited

## A Rotating Reference Frame

## The Equivalence Principle

## The Pound-Rebkha Experiment

## The Weight of a Box of Photons

## Einstein's Equation
