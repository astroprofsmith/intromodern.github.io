<h2>Time as a Dimension<a class="headerlink" href="#time-as-a-dimension" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>At the end of the last chapter, we argued that if the speed of light
was to be invariant – to be measured the same in any reference frame
– then the quantity <div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 - c^2dt^2\]</div>
 must also be
invariant across reference frames.  This formulation looks a lot like
a kind of 4 dimensional Pythagorean theorem, except for the minus sign
in the last term.  If it were not for that minus sign, we could well
imagine we were looking at the magnitude of a four-dimensional
displacment vector, just adding time as a new component.  If a
spacial displacement vector is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\vec{r} = (dx,dy,dz)\)</span>, and its
magnitude is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2\)</span>, perhaps it would make sense to have
a four-dimensional vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx_4 = (cdt,dx,dy,dz)\)</span>, except that
if we were to square each term and add them up, we would get
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+c^2dt^2\)</span>, not minus.  We need a way to remember to include that
minus sign.</p>
<p>There are two ways of keeping track of the minus sign.  One is simpler
for the beginner, and the other makes the more complicated material
later easier to manage.  The simpler way is to introduce complex
numbers as a bookkeeping trick.  If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i^2 = -1\)</span>, then we can write
the time component of the vector as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(icdt\)</span>, and its square will be
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-c^2dt^2\)</span>.  This method ensures that the minus sign always goes in
the right place.  There is nothing physical or mysterious about the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>; it is no more and no less than a handy way to keep track of where
to put the minus sign.  It always shows up in the time component of the
four-vector, and it never shows up in the space components.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>If you ever see a time component without an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>, or find an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> in
a space component, then you have made a mistake in your math somewhere.</p>
</div>
<p>With this tool, we can define a displacement four-vector as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eqdx4">
<span class="eqno">(6)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eqdx4" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\begin{split}[dx_4] =
\begin{bmatrix}
icdt\\
dx\\
dy\\
dz
\end{bmatrix}\end{split}\]</div>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">Example 3.1</p>
<p>An observer sees two events occuring. She measures a physical
displacement of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx = 1.20\)</span> m, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dy = 2.00\)</span> m and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dz = 0.00\)</span> m. The
time interval between these events is measured to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.0100\)</span>
microseconds. Write down the eleinents of the displacement 4 vector
measured by this observer and find the size of this displacement 4
vector.</p>
<p>The three spatial elements are given in the problem. What I need to do
is to calculate the size of the time component: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(cdt = 3\times10^8\)</span>
m/s <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((1.00\times 10^{-8}\)</span> s) = 3.00 m.  The displacement four vector
is therefore</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{equation*}
[dx_4] =
\begin{bmatrix}
i3.00~{\rm m}\\
1.20~{\rm m}\\
2.00~{\rm m}\\
0.00~{\rm m}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}\]</div>
<p>The size of this displacement 4 vector is:
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[(1.20^2+2.00^2)~{\rm m}^2 = -3.56~{\rm m}^2\]</div>
</p>
</aside>
<p>The “size” of this four-dimensional object would then be <div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[[dx_4]^2 =
dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 - c^2dt^2.\]</div>
 We need a better word than “size”, but
“magnitude” is not a good choice, because we are so used to how
magnitudes work with three-dimensional vectors.  The magnitude of a
three-vector is always positive (unless all three of its components
are zero), but <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([dx_4]^2\)</span> could be positive, negative, or zero!
For a displacement four-vector, we call the size the “interval”, but
there isn’t a better word than “size” for other four vectors.</p>
<p>What a person measures when light propagates is a set of four things:
the three components of the physical displacement and the time
interval it took to make this displacement. These values, when
arranged as above, can be thought of as 4 components of a
vector.  The vector is called the displacement 4-vector for the events.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>There is no consensus on what order to put the four components.
Some people put the three space components first and time in the
fourth position.  My own preference is to count from zero and put
time in the zeroth (first) position.  Then the space components
are still 1, 2, and 3, but time is a bit different, just like zero
is a bit different from the positive integers.  Having time first
also saves writing.  We often don’t need to use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>,
but if you put time last, you always need to write all four.  If you
put time first, you can sometimes only write the first two.  Finally,
if you find yourself in the unusual circumstance of needing to have
more than three spatial dimensions, it is easy to add 4, 5, 6, and so
on, but if time is in space four, then you have space dimensions
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, etc., which is confusing and harder to program in
a computer.</p>
</div>
<p>In general, a four vector is an object with four components,
one of which gets a minus sign when you square the components,
and the other three have the properties of normal three vectors.
The size of any four vector is the same in any inertial reference
frame, and to convert a four vector from one frame to another,
there is a specific procedure one must follow (see Chapter 4).</p>
<p>The second way involves being aware of a distinction between covariant
and contravariant four-vectors.  The mathematical details are not
necessary at this stage (see Appendix?), but suffice to say that the
contravariant version of a four vector should be written as a column,
as in Equation 6, only without the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>.  The standard notion is to use
a superscript greek letter to refer to the components, where the Greek
letter could stand for 0, 1, 2, or 3.  So</p>

<p>The superscript here does NOT mean “raised to the power of”.  In this
notation, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dy\)</span> would be written <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx^2\)</span>, but the 2 does not mean squared,
it means the third component of the contravariant four-vector.  If
people are using this notation, you have to be aware from the context
whether they mean a contravariant component or an exponent.</p>
</div>
<p>There is also a covariant version of the four-vector, which is written
as a row with a subscript Greek letter, but also includes the minus sign:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx_\alpha = [-cdt,dx,dy,dz]\)</span>.  For the four vectors we are considering,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx_0 =-dx^0\)</span>, but <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx_1=dx^1\)</span> and so forth.  So if you multiply the
two together, according to the rules of multiplying matrices,
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[dx_\alpha dx^\alpha = dx_0dx^0 + dx_1dx^1+dx_2dx^2+dx_3dx^3\]</div>

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[dx_\alpha dx^\alpha = -dx^0dx^0 + dx^1dx^1+dx^2dx^2+dx^3dx^3\]</div>

<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[dx_\alpha dx^\alpha = -c^2dt^2 + dx^2+dy^2+dz^2\]</div>

where in that last equation, the 2 does mean squared.</p>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"></p>
<p>The reason those relations work (like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx_0=-dx^0\)</span>) is because <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx_\mu\)</span>
can be written as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_{\mu\nu}dx^\nu\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_{\mu\nu}\)</span> is a 4x4
matrix called “the metric”.  All the off-diagonals of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_{\mu\nu}\)</span>
are zero, and the diagonals are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-1,1,1,1\)</span>.  So if you follow the
Einstein notation, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_{\mu\nu}dx^\nu\)</span> is a row with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((-dx^0,dx^1,
dx^2,dx^3)\)</span>.  The metric hold the information about the characteristics
of space – since all the values here are just <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pm 1\)</span>, we say we
are in “flat spacetime”.  If the values deviate from 1, we say the
space is curved.  This becomes the foundation of General Relativity.
Many people currently working in the field are skipping the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> method
altogether and going right to this notation from the beginning,
because it is absolutely
necessary in GR, but I am going to stick with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> until Chapter 11.</p>
</aside>
<p>In this notation, whenever there is a Greek letter that appears twice,
once up and once down, that is a shorthand for “multiply across the
row and down the column and add them up”.  It plays the same role as a
dummy variable in integration, and therefore does not appear in the
result.  This is called “Einstein summation notation” or just
“Einstein notation”, and it won’t come up again in this book until we
apply SR to Electromagnetism in Chapter 11.  I mention it here to stress
that using the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> is not the <strong>only</strong> way to keep track of the minus
sign.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For the purposes of this class, there are only three things you need
to remember about Einstein notation:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Greek letters represent the numbers 0 through 3.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is the same Greek letter above and below,
that represents a sum over the four possibilities, like a
dummy integration variable.  Letters that do not repeat
must stay in the same place on both sides of the equals.</p></li>
<li><p>If you raise or lower the index, you multiply the time
component by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-1\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are consistent with these three rules, you will get the
same answers as carrying around the factor of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>.  For most of this
book, we will use the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> notation, but when we get to the final
two chapters about electromagnetism, the Einstein notation is
much easier to work with, so it will come back then.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you have the concept of a four-vector, mathematically, it is
useful to also have a method of displaying them, graphically.  Such a
graph is called a “spacetime diagram”.  I will give a brief
introduction to them here, and then we will explore their properties
in much more depth in Chapter 5.</p>

<section id="spacetime-diagrams">
<h2>Spacetime Diagrams<a class="headerlink" href="#spacetime-diagrams" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Superficially, a spacetime diagram hardly seems worthy of its own
distinct name: the convention is to use the vertical axis to represent
time measurements (clock readings), and the horizontal axis to represent
one of the spatial dimensions (ruler readings).  Traditionally, we choose
to call this space axis <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>.  These are usually all the dimensions we
have on a two-dimensional display like a computer screen, although we
can cheat a little by adding a second spatial dimension in projection,
coming out of the screen.  A three-dimensional representation of such a
spacetime diagram is shown in Figure 3.1, along with some common features.</p>
<p>It is also traditional to multiply the time axis by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span>, using <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ct\)</span> as
the dimension, rather than just <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>.  This has two benefits: first,
this turns the dimensions of the axis from time into space, which
allows it to have the same scale as the horizontal axis.  This makes
it possible to compare lengths on both axes, which otherwise would
have different dimensions and therefore be incomparable (which is
bigger, one second or one meter?).  Second, the displacement four vector
has a time component of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(cdt\)</span>, so having the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> included in the axis
means that distances on the diagram can accurately represent the
components of the displacement four-vector.</p>

<p>Figure 3.1 – Three-dimensional spacetime diagram, which you can
rotate to observe from different angles.  Events are represented as
two spheres: orange and purple.  The displacement four vector between
them is black.  The components of this four vector are also drawn
as arrows parallel to the three axes.  Note that there could well be
enormous displacement in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> that would not show up on this diagram.
Click and drag to rotate the “cube” so that you are
looking face-on to the side bounded by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ct\)</span>, with the origin
in the lower left corner.  This is the standard way to draw a 2D
spacetime diagram.  The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> axis would then be diagonal in projection.
There is nowhere to put a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> axis on the computer screen.</p>
</div>
<p>Much of special relativity amounts to comparing a set of observations
in one reference frame to that of a second reference frame moving
relative to the first.  By convention, we usually define the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> axis
to point along the direction of the relative motion, so that the
second frame is moving to the right.  This is the default assumption,
although it is certainly not <strong>necessary</strong>.  If you must choose <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>
to lie in a different direction than the relative velocity, that
will make the math more complicated, so always make sure to draw
a picture before you start doing math, to make sure the equations
actually match the setup.  Figure 3.2 shows the standard way to
represent two spacetime diagrams in relative motion.</p>
<p>Events, being infinitesimal in duration and extent, are represented on
the spacetime diagram as dots.  A collection of events that represent
the motion of a single object through space over time are called a
worldline.  The tip of my nose at any given moment could be said to be
an event, and if I am not moving, then the worldline of my nose would
be a vertical line on a spacetime diagram.  If I were to walk at a
constant speed, my nose’s worldline would be a tilted straight line,
since for every time interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(cdt\)</span> I would have moved my nose a
distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx=vdt=\beta cdt\)</span>.  The slope of the line, rise over run,
would therefore be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/\beta\)</span>, since we put the time axis on the
vertical.  As my speed goes to zero, the slope becomes infinite: a
vertical line.  The lowest slope the worldline of a real object can
have is 1, since that would imply <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1/\beta=1\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v=c\)</span>, the fastest a
real object can move.</p>
<p>We’ll explore the implications of these properties more in the next chapter.
For now, it is sufficient to note that we can define a displacement
four-vector between two dots on a spacetime diagram, and that the
components of this four vector represent horizontal and vertical sides
of that triangle.  Be aware, however, that although this looks exactly
like a triangle, that pesky minus sign is still there, which means the
“size” of the hypoteneuse is not constrained to be positive, as it would
with a normal triangle!  If the sides are equal, the length is zero, not
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dx\sqrt{2}\)</span>.</p>

<h2>Examples of Displacement Four Vectors<a class="headerlink" href="#examples-of-displacement-four-vectors" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The key to using this model of special relativity to describe
physically real happenings is to be able to write down the
displacement 4-vector for that happening. To do this, there must be
two events occurring, events which both observers can detect. Then,
each observer measures the physical displacements andthe time interval
between the two events and converts them into the components of the
displacement 4-vector as shown in Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eqdx4">(6)</a>.</p>

<h3>Muon Decay<a class="headerlink" href="#muon-decay" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>For example, consider the following interesting happening. A pion is
traveling along in a bubble chamber, leaving a track of bubbles. At
some time and place, it decays into a muon. I know that something
happens because the track of bubbles changes direction. The muon moves
on for a while and then decays into an electron. Again, I know this
happens because the bubble track changes direction. The two events are
the change in direction of the tracks as shown in Figure 3.3.  Note
that the figure on the left is a diagram of what happens in space, while
the figure on the right is a spacetime diagram!</p>

A pion enters from the lower left going up and to the right, turns into a
muon and goes stright to the right, and then turns into an electron that goes
down and to the right.  This diagram tells you nothing about how fast the
particles are going, or how much time passes between the events.  On the right,
we have a spacetime diagram, which tells us nothing about the motion in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>

but does convey the velocity in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> direction (not the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span>!).
Can you describe how this velocity component changes throughout

<p>Often in SR problems, it is important to make a graph showing the
events under consideration, and to indicate the relative motion of
the reference frames, as in Figure 3.2.  This will help you visualize
what’s happening and ensure that you set up your equations properly.</p>
<p>Consider a space ship that leaves the Earth and travels 4.2 LY to the
star Alpha Centauri at a constant speed of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta=0.75\)</span>.  For this
scenario, there are two reference frames that are of interest: the one
that is at rest with respect to the space ship and another that is at
rest with respect to the earth. The two events will be the departure
from earth and the arrival at alpha centauri. The relative speed
between these two observers is just the speed of the space ship in the
direction of Alpha Centauri. The events can be diagrammed as shown in
Figure 3.3.</p>
<p>An observer that is at rest with respect to the earth will measure
(evenually – once all the rulers and clocks are returned and
collated) a physical displacement in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>-direction of the distance
between earth and Alpha Centauri: 4.2 light years. There will be no
physical displacement in the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> directions. There will be some
time interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt_\oplus\)</span> that the earth based observer will measure
for the trip. Since we know the velocity that the space is traveling
with respect to the earth, the time it takes to get to the star in the
Earth’s reference frame is <div class="math notranslate nohighlight">

<p>The half-life for a muon is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.20 \times 10^{-6}\)</span> seconds as ineasured

<p>The value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt_0 = 2.20\times 10^{-6}\)</span> s. What I am looking for is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt\)</span>.
Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eqtimed">(13)</a> relates the

</aside>
<p>This is the famous <strong>Time Dilation</strong>, which is sometimes characterized as
“moving clocks run slow”, but I find this phrase confusing, as all clocks
could be in motion, relative to something else.  A more precise formulation
is “a clock in a reference frame at rest with respect to two events will
measure the shortest possible time interval between those two events.”
This time interval, being unique, also gets a name, and is called the
<strong>proper time interval</strong>, and is often designated <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt_0\)</span>.
If you are not clear on which clock is moving, draw a spacetime diagram and
see whether the two events you are considering are in the same place.
Often, the confusion arises because someone is not carefully considering
what the two events in question actually are, and mistakenly compares
two different time intervals.</p>
<p>The quantity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{1-\beta^2}\)</span> comes up so often it has a name: the
Lorentz Factor, although it is usually more covenient to move it to the
other side of the equation, since the clock on the rocket is the one
at rest and therefore <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt_{\rm rocket}\)</span> is the proper time interval.
In this case,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eqtimed">
<span class="eqno">(13)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eqtimed" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[dt_\oplus = \frac{dt_{\rm rocket}}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}} = dt_{\rm rocket}\gamma,\]</div>

The Lorentz Factor is always greater than or equal to one (equality
in the case of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta=0\)</span> – no relative motion means the clocks will agree),
so the clocks in the Earth’s frame will always measure a longer time
interval, no matter the speed of the rocket.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The relationships <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta = \sqrt{1-1/\gamma^2}\)</span> are very useful to know.
When speeds
start to get close to the speed of light, we often just write the speed <strong>as
the Lorentz Factor</strong>, rather than converting it back to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span>, or
even <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span>.  So it would be perfectly acceptable to just say something
like “travelling with a speed of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma = 115\)</span>”, even though technically
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> is not a speed.</p>
</div>
<p>In the case presented here, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta = 0.75\)</span>, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma = 1.512\)</span>, and
therefore the clocks on the rocket will measure a time interval of 3.7
years.  This is a simplified version of the famous <strong>Twin Paradox</strong>,
which adds the extra step of bringing the rocket back to Earth at the
same speed, whereupon comparing the clocks shows that 7.4 years have
passed on the rocket while 11.2 years have passed on the Earth.  This
may seem science fictional, but an experiment much like it has been
carried out with jet planes going around the Earth in opposite
directions, carrying extremely precise atomic clocks.  The predicted
rates of time dilation had to be modified to account for the fact that
the planes were not inertial reference frames, but when correctly

<h3>Clock on a Train<a class="headerlink" href="#clock-on-a-train" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>One more example of how you can use four-vectors to predict time dilation.
Consider a clock, sitting on the floor of a train.  It is linked to a laser,
such that at a particular moment, it will cause the laser to flash.  The
laser is pointed at the ceiling of the train car, where a mirror reflects
the laser beam right back down to the floor, where a detector stops the
clock and therefore measures a time interval.</p>
<p>To put this narrative into mathematical format, we define two events:
the emission of the laser flash and the detection of the returning
light.  The emission and detection of the light happen at the same
position in space, so the clock is at rest with respect to the events,
and therefore the time interval it measures is the proper time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt_0\)</span>.
If the height of the train car is designated <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h\)</span>, then the proper time
interval will be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt_0 = 2h/c\)</span>, since the laser beam moves at the
speed of light.</p>
<p>Now consider that the train is moving along horizontal tracks at a
speed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v\)</span>, relative to the ground.  Standing on the ground is another
observer with a clock, and this observer starts and stops their clock
at the same events (note that we are not worrying about the time it
takes light to travel from the train to the person on the ground – we
are using these two clocks to stand in for the imaginary infinite lattice
of rulers and clock that make up our conceptual reference frames).
We say this person measures a time interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt\)</span> between the emission
and detection of the light.  How does <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt\)</span> compare with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt_0\)</span>?</p>
<p>First, there are three relevant events: the light beam is emitted
upward, it reflects off a mirror on the ceiling, and it returns to the
detector next to the clock.  These three events happen, so they must
happen in all reference frames.  Since according to the person on the
ground, the train is moving, the mirror will be a distance <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(vdt/2\)</span>
along the track when the light hits it, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(vdt\)</span> further along when
the light returns.  In the ground’s reference frame, the light must
therefore follow a triangular path, if it is to bounce off the mirror
and return to the detector.</p>
<p>This is the essence of time dilation: if the light is to travel a
longer path (the hypoteneuse of a triangle will be longer than the
vertical side) at the same speed, it must take more time to do so.
The length of the horizontal side of the triangle is the distance the
train moves, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(vdt/2\)</span> for each of the away and back segments.  The
diagonal path is therefore of length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\sqrt{h^2+(vdt/2)^2}\)</span>.  The
time interval the person on the ground will measure is thus:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[dt = \frac{D}{c} = \frac{2\sqrt{h^2+(vdt/2)^2}}{c}\]</div>
<p>Substitute in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(h=cdt_0/2\)</span> and square both sides to get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[dt^2  = \frac{4(cdt_0/2)^2+(vdt/2)^2}{c^2}\]</div>
<p>The four cancels, and if we multiply both sides by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c^2\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eqdxlaser">
<span class="eqno">(14)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eqdxlaser" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[c^2dt^2  = (cdt_0)^2+(vdt)^2 \rightarrow dt^2(c^2-v^2) = c^2dt_0^2\]</div>
<p>which means</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eqpropertd">
<span class="eqno">(15)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eqpropertd" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[dt  = dt_0\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}} = \gamma dt_0,\]</div>
<p>which is the same as Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eqtimed">(13)</a>!  The clock on the ground
will measure a longer time interval than the clock on the train by a
factor of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span>.  From the point of view of the person on the
ground, the clock on the train is therefore running slow, so often
time dilation is summarized as “moving clocks run slow.”</p>
<p>This is a confusing and imprecise statement, for all its pithy brevity.
One of the central premises of relativity is that all motion is relative.
So which clock is moving?  From the point of view of the train, the
ground is moving, but from the point of view of the ground, the train
is moving.  If “moving clocks run slow”, could we determine which clock
is running slow, and then that would tell us which clock is <strong>really</strong>
moving?</p>
<p>The trick is that you have to make sure you are making symmetric
comparisons.  From the ground, the train is moving, and therefore its
clock runs slow when measuring time intervals <strong>on the train</strong>.  To
make the comparison properly, if you wanted to test whether the clock
on the ground was running slow, because it is moving relative to the
train, you would have to pick two events at rest with respect to the
<strong>ground</strong>.  In other words, the phrase really should be “moving
clocks run slow when measuring the time interval between two events at
rest in the moving frame.”  Or, more clearly, “a clock at rest with
respect to two events will measure the shortest possible time interval
between those two events.”  There is only one frame where two events
are at rest, and that breaks the symmetry underlying the question
about which clock is moving.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Make sure you understand that nothing in SR makes any demands on what
kind of clock is being used to make the measurements.  Time dilation
is not a mechanical effect of the particular clock making the measurements.
<strong>Any</strong> spatially repeating system (rotation, vibration, oscillation)
can act as a clock, and <strong>all</strong> of them will measure time dilation.
It’s a necessary implication of the two postulates of Relativity,
a property of time itself, not a description of gears winding down or
some other feature of a particular kind of clock.</p>

<p>You can also express this example through the formalism of the displacement
four vectors.  In the reference frame of the train, the events of the
light being emitted and then being detected are in the same place, so
in the context of Figure 3.3, the train frame is the primed frame on
the right.  The reference frame at rest with respect to the ground
is the unprimed frame on the left.  The red dot is the emission of
the light and the blue dot is the detection of the light.  The
displacement four vector in the train frame would be:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-d8d23267-de92-4fc0-ad41-061a477c2af5">
<span class="eqno">(16)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-d8d23267-de92-4fc0-ad41-061a477c2af5" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\begin{equation}
[dx_4]_{\rm train} =
\begin{bmatrix}
icdt_0\\
0\\
0\\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}\]</div>
<p>while the displacement four vector from the ground’s reference frame is</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-530c722c-062f-4111-926f-e672e12228e5">
<span class="eqno">(17)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-530c722c-062f-4111-926f-e672e12228e5" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\begin{equation}
[dx_4]_{\rm ground} =
\begin{bmatrix}
icdt\\
vdt\\
0\\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}\]</div>
<p>Since the size of these four-vectors must be the same, that means
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[-c^2dt_0^2 = -c^2dt^2+v^2dt^2,\]</div>
 which is exactly the same as Equation
<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-eqdxlaser">(14)</a>, which means that, again, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boxed{dt = \gamma dt_0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite what seem to be complete different contexts, the underlying
physics of the rocket and the train are exactly the same, because
the rules of time are the same.</p>
