<h1>Chapter 13: Concepts of General Relativity<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-13-concepts-of-general-relativity" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Although a full treatment of General Relativity (GR) is far beyond the
scope of this book, I would like to leave you with some hints at
the major concepts you must grapple with, if you extend the theory
beyond the special case of reference frames moving with constant
relative velocities.</p>
<section id="the-twin-paradox-revisited">
<h2>The Twin Paradox Revisited<a class="headerlink" href="#the-twin-paradox-revisited" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>To begin our overview of GR, let us return to our old friend, the twin
paradox, and consider the following situation: we have two events in
the same location in space, one event later than the other in time.
We have two individual clocks that have been syncronized, and they are
both at the same location as the two events.  At the instant of the
first event, one of the clocks begins moving away.  You could consider
this to be the first event, if you like.  The other clock remains
stationary.  At some later time, the clock returns to the location of
the stationary clock.  This return marks the second event.  This
situation is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#twopaths"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 36</span></a>, where the red line represents
the worldline of the stationary clock and the blue curve represents
a possible path that the moving clock might take.  For our purposes,
the exact path the moving clock takes is unimportant, only that it
goes away and comes back.  It must also, of course, be a physically
possible trajectory: no doubling back along the time axis or moving
faster than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span>!</p>
<p>From what we learned about SR, we can consider the displacement
four-vector between the two events, and it would have a size given
by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-\Delta t_0^2\)</span>, the proper time between these two events, as measured
by the red clock.  However, it is not at all clear that the blue clock
will measure the same time interval.  Consider each worldline to be
made up of infinitely many, infinitely small four-diplacements between
events that are infinitesimally far apart along the colored lines.
Each step along the worldline would have its own four-displacement,
which would have its own size <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-ds^2=-c^2dt^2+dx^2\)</span>.  For the purposes
of this analysis, I am going to multiply through by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-1\)</span> and use
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ds = \sqrt{c^2dt^2-dx^2}\)</span>.  It’s not strictly necessary, but it makes
the argument easier to follow.</p>
<p>The total interval along each worldline would then be the integral
of all the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(ds\)</span> intervals for each of the steps.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-intint">
<span class="eqno">(260)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-intint" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\Delta S = \int_{\rm path} ds = \int_{\rm path} \sqrt{c^2dt^2-dx^2}\]</div>
<p>Factor out the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt\)</span> to make it easier to understand:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-intint2">
<span class="eqno">(261)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-intint2" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\Delta S = \int_{\rm path} cdt\sqrt{1-\frac{dx^2}{c^2dt^2}} = \int_{\rm path}
cdt\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\]</div>
<p>What we have here is a path integral of some function, call it <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span>,
that depends on the speed of the clock at each moment along the path:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f = \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}\)</span>.  For the red path, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v=0\)</span>, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f=1\)</span> and the
integral is trivially just the proper time.  However, along the blue
path <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\geq v^2&lt;1\)</span>, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0&lt;f\leq 1\)</span>, which means the result of this
integral (which is the time interval elapsed on the blue clock, as we
are integrating over <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dt\)</span>) is always going to be less than or equal to
the proper time.  In particular, for the twin paradox, if the blue path
were to involve traveling to some other star and back to the Earth,
the clock on the spaceship (the blue clock) would measure less time
than the clock on the Earth.  This is the same result we derived before
by only considering a one-way trip at constant speed.</p>
<p>No matter what path the blue clock takes, it will always measure less
time than the stationary (red) clock.  In this context, we can accurately
say that moving clocks run slow, because we are comparing two clocks
within the same reference frame.  When we first encountered time dilation,
we were considering the elapsed time between two events as measured by
infinite lattices of synchronized clocks, one set in motion relative to the
other set.  In this context, within a single reference frame, we can say
that a clock at rest with respect to two events will measure the LONGEST
time interval between those two events, as compared with any other clock
that follows a different path between the events.  This sounds like it
contradicts the previous formulation of time dilation, but you have to
consider carefully what is being compared.</p>

</figure>
<p>In SR, there is no question of returning to the same location
as the first event.  This would not be possible, as to turn
around and come back would require changing the relative velocity,
and SR only considers unchanging relative velocities.  In this
new context, there is an asymmetry between the moving clock and
the stationary clock, because only the moving clock <em>changes</em>
its motion.  The only way to describe these occurances from the
perspective of the blue clock would be to allow for accelerating
reference frames.</p>

Objects sitting on the dashboard would remain at rest (from your
point of view – an observer sitting on the side of the road
would see the objects moving at the same velocity as the car),
and if you threw a ball into the back seat, you would see it
move in a nice parabola.  If you had a helium balloon, it would
float upward to the length of its string.  The fuzzy dice hang
straight down from the rear view mirror.  All is calm.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the driver slams on the brakes.  The objects in the car
fly forward.  You feel thrown forward against the strap of your safety
belt.  The fuzzy dice swing forward toward the windshield.  From your
point of view, thinking in terms of Newton’s laws, a mysterious force
has just appeared that gives all the objects in the car an additional
forward velocity.  What happens to the helium balloon?  Take a moment
to think about that and make a prediction.  After you have decided, go
to watch <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8mzDvpKzfY">this video</a> to
see what the balloon actually does.</p>
<p>From the side of the road, there is no mysterious force.  All objects
continue moving forward, as their velocity would demand, but the car
slows down, as does therefore the safety strap, which pushes backwards
against you and slows you down to match the car.  The balloon is
lighter than air, so while the air in the car slides forward along
with you and the fuzzy dice, that pushes the lighter balloon toward
the back of the car.</p>
<p>If the driver had, instead of braking, turned the wheel hard to
the left, so that the car began moving in a circle, everything
in the car would behave as if there were a mysterious force pushing
to the right.  You would lean right, the fuzzy dice would dangle to
the right, and the balloon would lean to the left.  Although a person
on the side of the road would say everything in the car was trying
to go in a straight line, but the car was pushing to the left,
within the reference frame of the car, everything would be acting
as if a force to the right had suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>Let’s consider that circular trajectory in the context of
<a class="reference internal" href="#twopaths"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 36</span></a>.  What can we say about a clock that moves on a
circular path through spacetime?  Such a path is represented in
<a class="reference internal" href="#circularstfig"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 37</span></a>.  To get from the orange event to the purple
event, a clock at rest would just follow a vertical line, but the
black curve represents a clock that moves around in a circle.  Based
on the analysis of the previous section, such a clock would have to
measure a shorter time interval than the clock at rest (if the system
were sitting on a merry-go-round, we could consider the clock at rest
to be at the center axis of the rotating disc – such a clock would be
synchronized with the lattice of clocks making up the reference frame
at rest with the orange and purple events, even if the clock at the
center did not pass through those two events).</p>

<p>Within the reference frame of the purple and orange events (the clock
at rest), for a given constant angular velocity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span>, the larger
the radius of the circle, the faster the clock will have to move to
complete the circle (according to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(v=\omega r\)</span>) and therefore the
larger the discrepency in the time intervals, according to Equation
<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-intint2">(261)</a>.  A clock further out on the merry-go-round will be
moving faster and therefore measure a shorter time interval than a
clock closer to the center.  This would be very confusing to a person
<em>on</em> the merry-go-round, as to that person, neither clock would be
moving.  The person on the merry go round would have to conclude that
the stronger the centrifugal force, the slower the clocks run.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we also know that lengths contract at faster speeds, so
if a person at the edge of the merry-go-round were to lay down meter
sticks to measure the circumference of the circle, they would need
more meter sticks than they would have expected without relativity.
The radius of the circle, being perpendicular to the motion, is not
affected, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi r\)</span> is now less than the actual circumference,
according to the (contracted) meter sticks.</p>
<p>The circumference being equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi r\)</span> is proven within a flat (or
Euclidian) space.  If space is curved, that equation no longer holds.
Consider the circle formed by a latitude line near the South Pole:
because the Earth is curved, the measured radius of the Earth along
the surface is going to be longer than the radius of the circle you
would get by slicing a flat circle along the latitude line.  Therefore,
the circumference of the latitude circle will be shorter than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\pi r\)</span>,
because the Earth is curved.  Due to the length contraction of the
meter sticks, our scientist on the merry-go-round would also conclude
that she is in a curved space, as the geometry is not behaving according
to the rules of flat space, and the stronger the centrifugal force,
the more curvature she measures.</p>
<p>The effects on time and geometry are tightly linked to the
acceleration of the reference frame of the merry-go-round.  The larger
the radius, the larger the acceleration needs to be (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a=\omega^2 r\)</span>)
to maintain the circular path.  To someone on the merry-go-round,
there would seem to be a mysterious outward (centrifugal) force, and
to move toward the center would be to move “up” against this force,
and to move away from the center would be to move “down” with this
force.  The further down they go, the larger the effects of time
dilation and length contraction would get.  They would conclude their
spacetime was deviating more and more from Euclidean flatness.  The
same chain of logic holds for the acceleration due to gravity, because
the forces are equivalent.</p>

<section id="the-equivalence-principle">
<h2>The Equivalence Principle<a class="headerlink" href="#the-equivalence-principle" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Consider a rocket ship in deep space, far from any source of gravity.
If that rocket were moving at a constant speed, everything in the
rocket would drift around inside, because in the reference frame
moving with the rocket, everything would be moving together, and would
therefore be the same as if the rocket were not moving at all.  This
insight was first expressed by Galileo, although he talked about
sailing ships, rather than rockets.  It is only through the rocking of
the waves, he pointed out, the <em>deviations</em> from constant speed, that
we can tell the ship is moving.  On our rocket, a laser affixed to one
wall would shoot a horizontal beam straight across to the other side,
regardless of the rocket speed, because the photons depart the wall
with the same upward momentum as the rocket.  Whether that upward
velocity is zero or not, as long as it is constant, the result will be
the same.</p>
<p>However, if the rocket is accelerating, the objects in the rocket will
tend to “fall” to the floor.  To an observer outside the rocket,
watching the rocket accelerate on by, the objects are measured to be
moving at a constant velocity, while the floor is accelerating up to
meet them.  Until they actually touch the floor, they are just
drifting through deep space, unaware that anything else is happening.
From inside the rocket, though, the objects seem to be moving down to
the floor.  If the rocket is accelerating up at 9.8 m/s/s, it will
seem to anyone in the rocket that everything inside is experiencing a
downward force exactly equivalent to the gravity on Earth.</p>
<p>This insight, that free-falling objects are no different from objects
floating in deep space, was once described by Einstein as his happiest
thought.  The story goes that he was strolling through town and
saw painters working on a clock tower.  It occurred to him that if
one of the painters were to fall, the painter would effectively feel
no gravity until he hit the ground (not so happy for the painter).
In the SR part of this book, we insisted on only dealing with reference
frames moving at constant speed, which we considered to be “inertial
reference frames”.  However, a reference frame in gravitational free
fall is <em>also</em> an inertial frame, because it is no different from
a reference frame that is not moving in the absence of gravity.</p>
<p>There is a deep mystery in introductory Physics that is often glossed
over, and perhaps not even mentioned.  Gravity is introduced through
Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, that any two masses in the
universe attract each other in proportion to the product of their
masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
between them, or</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-newugrav">
<span class="eqno">(262)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-newugrav" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\vec{F} = -\frac{GMm}{r^2}\hat{r}.\]</div>
<p>Teachers have also by this point probably introduced Newton’s
famous second law, often expressed that the total force on a system is
proportional to the rate of change of the velocity of a system,
with the constant of proportionality being called the mass, or</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-new2law">
<span class="eqno">(263)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-new2law" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\vec{F} = m\vec{a}.\]</div>
<p>For a falling object near the Earth’s surface, these two forces are
equated and the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> term cancels out, indicating that the acceleration
of any object near the surface of the Earth is the same, and we use
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(GM/R^2\)</span> with values for the mass and radius of the Earth to get
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g\equiv GM/R^2 = 9.8\)</span> m/s/s.  The velocity of any object falling
near the Earth’s surface will change by 9.8 m/s every second, regardless
of that object’s mass.</p>
<p>Buried in the chain of logic was a big assumption, so big and obvious
that most students don’t even notice, and often are confused when it
is actually pointed out to them: there is nothing in that description
that demands that the two times <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> is used, they must be referring to
the same thing.  The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> in Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-newugrav">(262)</a> is defined in
terms of how strongly masses pull on each other through gravity.  The
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> in Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-new2law">(263)</a> is defined in terms of how much an
object’s velocity changes when you push on it.  There’s nothing in
those two definitions that says those two <em>have</em> to be the same thing!
It’s a huge assumption and a complete mathematical slight of hand
trick to define them with the same letter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m\)</span> in the first place.</p>
<p>Say something about experimental tests.</p>
<p>Einstein’s theory of General Relativity insists that they are indeed
the same thing, and provides a reason why that might be the case.
If what we call gravity is indeed a kind of illusion caused by being
in a curved spacetime, then falling objects aren’t really falling,
but rather just drifting through spacetime as they normally would,
until the ground, or the floor of the rocket, comes up from below and
hits them.  Everything falls at the same rate because everything
is drifting together through a curved spacetime.  GR suggests that
you will never be able to do any experiment to be able to tell
the difference between these two situations (standing on the Earth
vs. standing on the floor of an accelerating rocket), because they
are equivalent.</p>
<p>Consider again the accelerating car.  However, now imagine the car is
parked.  Everything in the car will behave according to Newton’s laws:
the dice will hang down, the safety strap will not press against you,
and the balloon will rise straight up to the top of its string.  If,
now, the Incredible Hulk were to grab the back of the car and lift it
up, such that the car were tilted at a large angle, consider what
would happen inside the car: the dice would shift forward, you would
feel pushed against the safety belt, and the balloon would tilt back
toward the back of the car.  An observer outside would say everything
is simply staying oriented to gravity’s “down”, but inside the car, it
would seem like a mysterious force was pushing foward, <em>exactly</em> as if
the driver had slammed on the brakes.  In fact, if the two kinds of
mass are truly equivalent, there is absolutely no difference between
braking the car and tilting the car.  In one case, we would say a
mysterious “fictional” force was adding a horizontal compontent to the
total force on objects in the car, and in the other case, we would say
that the force of gravity was rotating, so that it gained a horizontal
component that wasn’t there before.  In both cases, the total force
vector, from the point of view of everything inside the car, would
swing from vertically down to diagonally down and forward.</p>
<p>This insight is so important that this “Equivalence Principle”
occupies a similar place in the foundation of GR that the two
postulates of SR do for that theory.  Within the formulation of GR,
what we consider to be a force that we call Gravity is really an
illusion of objects trying to move through curved spacetime, just like
the balloon and the fuzzy dice aren’t really being pushed by invisible
forces in the accelerating car.</p>

<section id="the-pound-rebkha-experiment">
<h2>The Pound-Rebkha Experiment<a class="headerlink" href="#the-pound-rebkha-experiment" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>If the Equivalence Principle is valid, than <em>any</em> situation where the
acceleration of a reference frame changes should have equivelent
inertial effects and gravitational effects.  There should not be any
way to distinguish between them.  In particular, consider the
merry-go-round described in the previous section.  The further out you
go along the radius of the rotation, the more acceleration you would
experience, and the slower your clocks would be running, compared with
a clock at the axis.  The centrifugal force is therefore equivalent to
gravity, with “out” being “down” and “in” being “up”.  Therefore, a
clock that is further “down” in gravity (closer to the Earth) should
run more slowly than a clock that is further “up” (away from the
Earth).</p>
<p>The frequency of a photon is a perfectly good clock – it oscillates
in time and therefore can mark off the nanoseconds as well as any
other clock.  If we shine light upward from the surface of the Earth,
its frequency should decrease as it goes upward, because the higher
clock will perceive it as coming from a lower clock that is running
more slowly, as per the arguments in the first few sections.  This
“gravitational redshift” can also be understood in terms of energy: if
you throw a ball upward, it loses energy as it climbs.  The ball’s
energy manifests in its speed.  The rising ball slows down.  A photon
cannot slow down – it loses energy by shifting to a lower frequency.
This is yet another counter-intuitive way that a massless particle
acts in ways that we previously only associated with mass.  We can’t
calculate the potential energy of the interaction of the Earth and a
photon in the same way that we would the interaction of the Earth and
the ball: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(mgh\)</span> makes no sense for the photon.  However, we have
learned the photon has momentum despite having no mass, so perhaps it
is not so surprising that it can lose energy in climbing upward, too.</p>
<p>To try to put this into quantitative form, let us consider the
energy of a photon, proportional to its frequency: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E=hf\)</span>.  If
this energy has an equivalent inertia to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E/c^2\)</span>, then we would
expect the energy of the photon to drop by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dE = -Eg(dy)/c^2\)</span> as it moves
a height <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dy\)</span> up from the Earth’s surface.  Divide both sides by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(hf\)</span> to get</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-gravred">
<span class="eqno">(264)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-gravred" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\frac{df}{f} = \frac{g}{c^2}dy.\]</div>
<p>For reasonable distances (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sim 10\)</span> m) near the surface of the Earth,
this consititutes a fractional frequency shift of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sim 10^{-15}\)</span>.
This is a very, very tiny change, and very difficult to measure.</p>
<p>In 1960, Robert Pound and his student Glen Rebkha at Harvard
set out to measure this tiny shift.  They positioned a source
of X-rays (X-rays with a well-known frequency) at the bottom of
of a tower, and a detector at the top of the tower, 21 m above.
It would be impossible to measure a fractional shift of one part
in a thousand trillion directly, so they positioned a filter in
front of the detector.  The filter would only allow X-rays through
if they matched the original frequency of the emitted X-rays from
the source.</p>
<p>They set the filter on a vibrating frame.  By controlling how the
filter oscillated up and down, they could cycle through many relative
speeds between the filter and the source of X-rays.  From the
reference frame of the filter, the X-rays would be Doppler-shifted.
When the filter was moving upward, the Doppler shift would be a
redshift, and when the filter was moving downward the Doppler shift
would be a blue shift.  At just the right downward speed, the Doppler
blueshift would cancel out the gravitational redshift and allow the
X-rays through to the detector.</p>
<p>Such a short description makes it sound easy, but only because the
gory details are beyond the scope of this book.  Pound and Rebkha
performed many runs over years, refining their measurements and paying
careful attention to sources of error.  See, for example, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound%E2%80%93Rebka_experiment">the
Wikipedia
page</a>
about the experiment.  Their first ten-day run reported a
gravitational redshift of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-(2.56\pm0.25)\times10^{-15}\)</span>, a 10%
uncertainty which they were able to eventually refine down to 1%.
Think about that!  Such a small difference is equivalent to two clocks
losing only one relative second over a 15 million year time interval!</p>

<section id="the-weight-of-a-box-of-photons">
<h2>The Weight of a Box of Photons<a class="headerlink" href="#the-weight-of-a-box-of-photons" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This gravitational redshift leads to an interesting thought
experiment.  Back in Chapter 8, the last problem asked you to consider
a box of photons and whether those photons might have an inertia
equivalent to some amount of mass.  Hopefully you figured out that the
inertia came from reflecting the photons off the inside walls of the
box.  If you wanted to move the box, say to the right, then the
photons bouncing off the left (approaching) wall must pick up
energy/momentum, and the photons bouncing off the right (receding)
wall must lose energy/momentum.  By conservation of momentum, you
will measure a force resisting your pushing the box, as if the
contents of the box had mass.</p>
<p>The same result applies to a box sitting on the ground in Earth’s
gravity.  The photons travelling upward will lose energy according to
Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-gravred">(264)</a>, such that on average they will have a
fractional energy loss of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(gy/c^2\)</span> relative to the ones hitting the
bottom of the box.  There’s no change in the horizontal directions, so
I only need to consider the photons going up and down – sideways
motion will average out to zero.</p>
