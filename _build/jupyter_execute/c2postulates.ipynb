    "# Chapter 2:  Postulates of Relativity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two Postulates of Relativity\n",
    "\n",
    "All of relativity follows from two surprisingly simple postulates.\n",
    "Once you accept these postulates, you can use the tools of mathematics\n",
    "to derive predictions for how space and time will behave, and how\n",
    "objects will move within them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to express this postulate is to assert that there is no\n",
    "universally preferred, or absolute, reference frame.  If you are on a\n",
    "train moving East, and I am on a train moving West, there is no\n",
    "physical experiment we can perform that will tell us who is \"really\"\n",
    "moving.  You might try to assert that while both trains are moving,\n",
    "the ground is not, but of course, the Earth is spinning and orbiting a\n",
    "star that is itself orbiting a galaxy that is drifting through the\n",
    "universe.  The closest thing there is to a universal reference frame\n",
    "is the reference frame of the cosmic microwave background radiation,\n",
    "which permeates the whole universe as a record of that moment when\n",
    "most of space became transparent about 14 billion years ago.  That's a\n",
    "very large system to choose as a reference, but the choice is\n",
    "arbitrary.  There's nothing about the universe that says even that\n",
    "choice is more natural than any other.  Once you choose a reference\n",
    "frame, any set of experiments or measurements you carry out will\n",
    "follow the same set of rules as they would in any other reference\n",
    "frame.  The answers could be different, but they wouldn't be \"more\n",
    "right\" or \"more wrong\" than measurements carried out in some other\n",
    "inertial reference frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most surprising one, but as explained above, nature seems\n",
    "to have forced this idea onto us.  No other speed behaves like this.\n",
    "When someone walks forward on an airplane in flight, a fellow\n",
    "passenger would perceive them as walking at a meter per second or so,\n",
    "but someone on the ground would perceive them as moving at hundreds of\n",
    "meters per second.  This seems obvious.  The premise that light from a\n",
    "flashlight on an airplane would be measured as having the same speed\n",
    "on the plane as from the ground seems absurd.  However, as explained\n",
    "in Chapter 1, this is what actually does happen in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inertial Reference Frames and Events\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"inertial reference frame\" has come up several times already.\n",
    "Before we go any further, we need to be very clear on what this term\n",
    "means.  In essence, a \"reference frame\" refers to a single set of\n",
    "space and time coordinates.  Pick an origin in space and time, and\n",
    "then clock readings mark locations along a time axis, and ruler\n",
    "readings mark locations along spacial axes, which usually are the\n",
    "standard cartesian x, y, and z.  Four numbers can therefore define a\n",
    "moment location in space at a moment in time, relative to the chosen\n",
    "origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between two ruler readings along an axis is\n",
    "called a displacement (if the two points in question are not along the\n",
    "same axis, we must use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the amount of\n",
    "displacement along the diagonal, or we can express the total\n",
    "displacement as a vector with a displaceent along each axis).  The\n",
    "difference between two clock readings is called a time interval or a\n",
    "duration.  If you consider smaller and smaller durations and\n",
    "displacements, the region described by these numbers will shrink to be\n",
    "a mathematical point in space and an instantaneous moment in time.\n",
    "This is sometimes represented as a finger snap or a lightning flash,\n",
    "although in reality neither of those actions are infinitesimal in\n",
    "extent.  An infinitesimal chunk of space and time is called an\n",
    "\"event\".  The total collection of all events is considered to be\n",
    "\"reality\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If reality is the collection of all events that happen throughout\n",
    "space and time, the question that concerns us in this course on\n",
    "Special Relativity is how these events are measured by different\n",
    "observers in relative motion.  We need to be a bit more specific about\n",
    "what it means to establish a system of coordinates in space and time.\n",
    "Typically by the time you reach the age at which you are reading this\n",
    "book, you will already take for granted the idea that space and time\n",
    "are a kind of fixed lattice underlying reality as we know it, and that\n",
    "locations in space and time have an absolute meaning independent of\n",
    "who is trying to measure them.  One of the goals of this book is to\n",
    "convince you this intuitive picture does not actually match reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we must be more specific about what these four numbers are\n",
    "and how they might be measured.  The typical image that is called\n",
    "forth to represent this process is a lattice of rulers and clocks.\n",
    "Imagine you had an infinite number of clocks and also an infinite\n",
    "number of rulers.  You painstakingly synchronize all these clocks, and\n",
    "confirm that the rulers are all not different in length.  Now, you\n",
    "very slowly move the clocks out through space, putting one at the end\n",
    "of each ruler, and then extending the rulers out from each placed\n",
    "clock, so that in the end, you have a lattice of cubes made by the\n",
    "rulers, with a clock at each vertex.  The location of each clock is\n",
    "therefore the number of rulers in each direction from the origin, and\n",
    "each clock has a reading, based on the overall synchronization.  A\n",
    "single event, therefore, can be recorded as happening at the nearest\n",
    "clock (as long as these rulers are imaginary, we can imagine them\n",
    "being as small as we need them to be to achieve the desired spacial\n",
    "resolution), marked at that clock reading: $x$, $y$, $z$, and $t$.\n",
    "Those numbers can be collected after the events by bringing the clocks\n",
    "back together and collating their readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept of an infinite lattice of synchronized clocks represents\n",
    "our idea of a \"reference frame\".  As long as we are imagining an\n",
    "infinite lattice, we can imagine a second infinite lattice (or a\n",
    "third, or as many as we like) that is passing through the first,\n",
    "moving at a constant relative velocity.  This velocity could be\n",
    "measured by recording when certain clocks pass each other, and when\n",
    "the clocks are gathered up again later, the number of rulers traveled\n",
    "divided by the durations on the relevant clocks would reveal the\n",
    "relative velocity, which we will designate as $v_R$.  For special\n",
    "relativity, we require that $v_R$ be constant.  Figure 2.1 shows an\n",
    "animated representation of two reference frames in relative motion,\n",
    "although you have to imagine the lattice of rulers and clocks\n",
    "extending off to infinity."

    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we are interested in how objects in the universe move and\n",
    "interact with each other.  To study this motion, we need to make\n",
    "measurements of location and duration, which needs to happen within a\n",
    "chosen reference frame.  Measurements recorded in different reference\n",

    "the observers at rest with respect to the second reference frame, the\n",
    "object and the lattice of rulers and clocks with it would be moving,\n",
    "not their own lattice of rulers and clocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important assumption we must make about the reference frames\n",
    "we consider in special relativity is that they be \"inertial frames\".\n",
    "What this means, simply expressed, is that Newton's laws are accurate\n",
    "when objects are observed within the frame.  Objects' velocities do\n",
    "not change unless a force acts upon them, momentum and energy are\n",
    "conserved, and so forth.  An example of a non-inertial reference frame\n",
    "would be if you put the reference frame lattice on a carousel.  Using\n",
    "this rotating lattice of rulers and clocks, objects could be observed\n",
    "to move in complicated, changing patterns, without any observable\n",
    "forces causing the changes in motion (so we make up fictitious forces\n",
    "and call them names like \"centrifugal\" to make Newton's laws keep\n",
    "working).  The rules of special relativity only work in inertial\n",
    "reference frames.  Usually, but not always, this means reference\n",
    "frames that have constant velocity, including zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Correlaries to the Postulates\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing physical can travel faster than $c$.  We will see why in later\n",
    "chapters of this book, but it's important to be aware of that from the\n",
    "beginning.  Once you demand that a speed be the same in all reference\n",
    "frames, as the first postulate does, the universe will conspire to\n",
    "make sure nothing moves faster than that.  It's important to note that\n",
    "we call this speed \"the speed of light\", but that's because light,\n",
    "having no inertial mass, moves at the fastest speed possible.  Light\n",
    "will slow down in materials like water or glass, so if we're being\n",
    "careful, we should call this speed \"the speed of light in a vacuum\".\n",
    "But really, it's the speed light moves in a vacuum simply because\n",
    "that's the fastest speed the universe allows.  Anything with no\n",
    "inertial mass will move at that speed (the particles called neutrinos\n",
    "also have almost no mass, and they move that fast, too).  So it is not\n",
    "possible for anything to move from one place to another faster than\n",
    "$c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For precisely that reason, you can't \"just know\" what's happening at\n",
    "some other location than your own.  It takes time for anything, anything\n",
    "that might convey information or have an effect, to move.  Even when\n",
    "you look across the room, you are seeing the room as it was a few\n",
    "nanoseconds ago.  The Moon you see in the sky is the Moon as it was\n",
    "about a second ago.  The Sun that shines on us is the Sun from eight\n",
    "minutes ago.  We often describe physical situations as if we have an\n",
    "instantaneous overview of everything everywhere all at once.  This is\n",
    "impossible.  Even to measure the ends of an object with a ruler demands\n",
    "either moving one's self to the other side of the object, or sending a\n",
    "light beam to the other side and back.  Many misunderstandings and\n",
    "confusions in special relativity arise from people assuming they just\n",
    "know what is going on at another location, without allowing for the\n",
    "time it would take to get from one location to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of special relativity is about comparing measurements according\n",
    "to two different reference frames that are in motion relative to each\n",
    "other.  *Special* relativity demands the assumption that the relative\n",
    "velocity between the frames is constant (a \"special\" case).  If the\n",
    "motion of the reference frames is not constant, the theory must be\n",
    "modified to a more general form, which makes it General Relativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have two different reference frames, it is important to state\n",
    "three characteristics that might seem self-evident, but they have\n",
    "important implications that are worth articulating explicitly.  First,\n",
    "imagine each frame of reference has a set of observers associated with\n",
    "it, or acting within it.  Each set of observers has to agree that the\n",
    "same events happened.  Switching reference frames does not change what\n",
    "actually happens.  People in different reference frames may well\n",
    "disagree on when and where events happen, but they should not disagree\n",
    "on *whether* the events happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, each set of observers must agree on what the results of\n",
    "measurements are.  Not only must there be agreement within the set of\n",
    "observers within a particular reference frame, but each set of\n",
    "observers must agree on what measurements are made in another\n",
    "reference frame.  Those measurements might well contradict each other,\n",
    "but all observers should agree on what they are.  For example, if a\n",
    "set of observers in reference frame 1 agree that a room is 12 m\n",
    "across, a set of observers in reference frame 2 should not be able to\n",
    "truthfully assert that the first set of observers actually measured\n",
    "the room to be 11 m across.  The second set of observers could\n",
    "feasibly measure the room to be 11 m across, themselves, but they\n",
    "should agree that the first set of observers measured 12 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "All sets of observers should agree that causes come before effects.\n",
    "We will find that switching reference frames will change many aspects\n",
    "of space and time that you are used to thinking of as universal.\n",
    "However, causes must still come before effects.  This is, as some have\n",
    "suggested, a kind of definition of time.  As the old saying goes,\n",
    "“Time... is what keeps everything from happening at once.”\n",
    "(R. Cummings, \"The Girl in the Golden Atom\", 1919).  See also [this\n",
    "Science Asylum YouTube\n",
    "video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HBKEDyFTv8).  Not an\n",
    "**operational** definition, mind you, but a useful description.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model to describe the experimental results.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interpretation of Michelson's experimental results is to say that\n",
    "observers in any inertial reference frame will measure that light\n",
    "travels at the same speed.   This is quite in contrast to how sound\n",
    "moves through the air. If I am moving towards the source, the sound\n",
    "seems to be traveling faster than when I am moving away from the\n",
    "source of the sound.   If an inertial observer measures the speed of\n",
    "the photons that come from a flashlight that she holds in her hand,\n",
    "she would get the value $c = 3.0 \\times 10^8$ m/s. If a second\n",
    "observer, moving at a speed of $2.8 \\times 10^8$ runs away from (or\n",
    "towards) the flash light would also measure the speed of the photons\n",
    "emitted by that same flashlight to be $c$, precisely the same value as\n",
    "the other observer. This is intuitatively absurd, but it agrees with\n",
    "the experiments, so it is a 'not wrong' model for the propagation of\n",
    "light.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step in developing the model is to transform this literary\n",
    "statement into mathematical terms so that quantitative predictions can\n",
    "be made. Consider a point source emitting light waves in three\n",
    "dimension. An observer would see the light waves traveling out in the\n",
    "shape of a sphere whose radius is dependent of time (as seen in\n",
    "Figure 2.2). As the light is emitted, in some very small\n",
    "time interval $dt$, the wave front makes a spherical shape of radius\n",
    "$r = c dt$. The 3-dimensional equation for a spherical shape centered\n",
    "at the origin is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: eqsph\n",
    "x^2+y^2+z^2= r^2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using the distances represented by the arrows in Figure 2.2, equation {eq}`eqsph` becomes:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: eqsph2\n",
    "(dx)^2+(dy)^2+(dz)^2 = (cdt)^2,\n",
    "```\n",
    "where $dx$, $dy$, and $dz$ are how much the observer measured the wave\n",
    "front to propagate during the time interval $dt$, and $c$ is the speed\n",
    "of light as measured by the observer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a second reference frame, which we designate \"the primed\n",
    "frame\" (all variables measured in this frame will have a prime on\n",
    "them, like $x^\\prime$), traveling at a constant speed $v_R$ in the\n",
    "$\\hat{x}$ direction with respect to the first observer (the first\n",
    "observer finds the source of the light flash to be at rest).  If this\n",
    "second observer were to observe the same set of events (the wave front\n",
    "of the light propagating away from the point source), what should she\n",
