    "# Chapter 1:  Roots of Relativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the set of predictions and interpretations that\n",
    "make up what we call \"Special Relativity\" (or SR), it's important to\n",
    "lay some groundwork and establish some definitions for what we will be\n",
    "talking about.  Much of SR will twist and challenge what you thought\n",
    "you knew about space and time, so it is important to define our terms\n",
    "carefully and precisely, or else it can get very confusing as to what\n",
    "we are actually talking about.  In this chapter, we will describe the\n",
    "rules by which the game of SR is played, and describe some of the\n",
    "reasons why those rules have been accepted.  It's important to know,\n",
    "right from the beginning, that the predictions of relativity, in both\n",
    "the general and specific forms, have passed every single test to which\n",
    "they have been subjected.  As far as we can tell, the universe really\n",
    "does work this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the 1900s, a popular theory about the propagation of light\n",
    "waves was that they traveled in some medium called the 'ether'. The\n",
    "'ether' plays the analogous role that the air plays in the propagation\n",
    "of sound. The physical properties of the air determine the speed of\n",
    "the sound waves. In the case of the 'ether', it supported a speed of\n",
    "propagation of $3.0 \\times 10^8$ m/s. Following the usual practices of\n",
    "physics, the validity of this theory would be determined by\n",
    "experiments. As a test of this theory, in 1881, Michelson did an\n",
    "experiment to measure the relative velocity of the ether with respect\n",
    "to the earth. The 'best' ether theory of the time suggested that the\n",
    "ether was at rest with respect to the fixed stars. The earth orbits\n",
    "the sun once a year at an orbital speed of about $3.0 \\times 10^4$\n",
    "m/s.  If a light beam on earth travels in the same direction as the\n",
    "orbital motion about the sun, then that beam of light is in a frame of\n",
    "reference that is moving at $3.0 \\times 10^4$ m/s with respect to the\n",
    "speed of the ether. If the beam of light is heading towards the sun,\n",
    "it is moving in a frame of reference that is at respect to the ether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Michelson designed an interferometer (schematically shown in Figure\n",
    "1.1) that used partially silvered mirrors to split a beam of light\n",
    "into two legs that were at right angles to each other. By careful\n",
    "examination of the interference of the light after it traveled along\n",
    "the two beam lines and was recombined by the partially silvered\n",
    "mirrors, he could measure a difference in speed of light in the two\n",
    "arms of about 300 m/s, much smaller than the orbital speed of the\n",
    "earth about the sun. The interferometer was floated on a pot of\n",
    "mercury and allowed to rotate slowly. During a rotation of 360\n",
    "degrees, at one time one of the legs would be pointing in the\n",
    "direction of motion of the earth (moving with respect to the ether)\n",
    "and the other at rest with respect to the ether. A quarter of a turn\n",
    "later, the light in the arm that was at rest with respect to the ether\n",
    "would be moving and vice versa. This anticipated change in the speed\n",
    "of light when the either was at rest with respect to the mirrors or\n",
    "moving with respect to the mirrors in the other arm could be detected\n",
    "in the changing of the interference pattern of the combined beams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much to Michelson's surprise, he measured no difference in speed as\n",
    "the arm was at rest with respect to the ether or moving with respect\n",
    "to the ether. Michelson had this terse description of the experiment:\n",
    "\"The interpretation of these results is that there is no displacement\n",
    "of the interference bands. ... The result of the hypothesis of a\n",
    "stationary ether is thus shown to be incorrect.\" (A. A. Michelson,\n",
    "Am. J. Sci, 122, 120 (1881)).  Michelson was encouraged by some\n",
    "important English physicists to continue his research. Along with\n",
    "E.W. Morley, he built a much bigger interferometer that had multiple\n",
    "mirrors and was 10 times as sensitive to the relative motion. He could\n",
    "measure a relative velocity of 30 m/s. Again, they found no\n",
    "difference in the speed in the two arms. (A. A. Michelson and\n",
    "E. W. Morley, Am. J. Sci., 134, 333 (1887)). The experiment was\n",
    "repeated often over the next few years, at even greater precision, but\n",
    "always gave the same null result: there is no stationary ether. As a\n",
    "consequence of his careful and brilliant work about the nature of the\n",
    "propagation of light, Michelson was awarded the Nobel prize in 1907.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most interesting experiments, Michelson got a result that did\n",
    "not agree with his intuition about the outcome of the\n",
    "experiment. After a number of very bright physicists examined these\n",
    "results, a relatively simple and rather clever model was developed\n",
    "that agreed with the experimental results."

    "## The Postulates of Relativity\n",
    "\n",
    "All of relativity follows from two surprisingly simple postulates.\n",
    "Once you accept these postulates, you can use the tools of mathematics\n",
    "to derive predictions for how space and time will behave, and how\n",
    "objects will move within them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most surprising one, but as explained above, nature seems\n",
    "to have forced this idea onto us.  No other speed behaves like this.\n",
    "When someone walks forward on an airplane in flight, a fellow\n",
    "passenger would perceive them as walking at a meter per second or so,\n",
    "but someone on the ground would perceive them as moving at hundreds of\n",
    "meters per second.  This seems obvious.  The premise that light from a\n",
    "flashlight on an airplane would be measured as having the same speed\n",
    "on the plane as from the ground seems absurd.  However, as introduced\n",
    "above, this is what actually does happen in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to express this postulate is to assert that there is no\n",
    "universally preferred, or absolute, reference frame.  If you are on a\n",
    "train moving East, and I am on a train moving West, there is no\n",
    "physical experiment we can perform that will tell us who is \"really\"\n",
    "moving.  You might try to assert that while both trains are moving,\n",
    "the ground is not, but of course, the Earth is spinning and orbiting a\n",
    "star that is itself orbiting a galaxy that is drifting through the\n",
    "universe.  The closest thing there is to a universal reference frame\n",
    "is the reference frame of the cosmic microwave background radiation,\n",
    "which permeates the whole universe as a record of that moment when\n",
    "most of space became transparent about 14 billion years ago.  That's a\n",
    "very large system to choose as a reference, but the choice is\n",
    "arbitrary.  There's nothing about the universe that says even that\n",
    "choice is more natural than any other.  Once you choose a reference\n",
    "frame, any set of experiments or measurements you carry out will\n",
    "follow the same set of rules as they would in any other reference\n",
    "frame.  The answers could be different, but they wouldn't be \"more\n",
    "right\" or \"more wrong\" than measurements carried out in some other\n",
    "inertial reference frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inertial Reference Frames and Events\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"inertial reference frame\" has come up several times already.\n",
    "Before we go any further, we need to be very clear on what this term\n",
    "means.  In essence, a \"reference frame\" refers to a single set of\n",
    "space and time coordinates.  Pick an origin in space and time, and\n",
    "then clock readings mark locations along a time axis, and ruler\n",
    "readings mark locations along spacial axes, which usually are the\n",
    "standard cartesian x, y, and z.  Four numbers can therefore define a\n",
    "moment location in space at a moment in time, relative to the chosen\n",
    "origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between two ruler readings along an axis is\n",
    "called a displacement (if the two points in question are not along the\n",
    "same axis, we must use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the amount of\n",
    "displacement along the diagonal, or we can express the total\n",
    "displacement as a vector with a displaceent along each axis).  The\n",
    "difference between two clock readings is called a time interval or a\n",
    "duration.  If you consider smaller and smaller durations and\n",
    "displacements, the region described by these numbers will shrink to be\n",
    "a mathematical point in space and an instantaneous moment in time.\n",
    "This is sometimes represented as a finger snap or a lightning flash,\n",
    "although in reality neither of those actions are infinitesimal in\n",
    "extent.  An infinitesimal chunk of space and time is called an\n",
    "\"event\".  The total collection of all events is considered to be\n",
    "\"reality\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If reality is the collection of all events that happen throughout\n",
    "space and time, the question that concerns us in this course on\n",
    "Special Relativity is how these events are measured by different\n",
    "observers in relative motion.  We need to be a bit more specific about\n",
    "what it means to establish a system of coordinates in space and time.\n",
    "Typically by the time you reach the age at which you are reading this\n",
    "book, you will already take for granted the idea that space and time\n",
    "are a kind of fixed lattice underlying reality as we know it, and that\n",
    "locations in space and time have an absolute meaning independent of\n",
    "who is trying to measure them.  One of the goals of this book is to\n",
    "convince you this intuitive picture does not actually match reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we must be more specific about what these four numbers are\n",
    "and how they might be measured.  The typical image that is called\n",
    "forth to represent this process is a lattice of rulers and clocks.\n",
    "Imagine you had an infinite number of clocks and also an infinite\n",
    "number of rulers.  You painstakingly synchronize all these clocks, and\n",
    "confirm that the rulers are all not different in length.  Now, you\n",
    "very slowly move the clocks out through space, putting one at the end\n",
    "of each ruler, and then extending the rulers out from each placed\n",
    "clock, so that in the end, you have a lattice of cubes made by the\n",
    "rulers, with a clock at each vertex.  The location of each clock is\n",
    "therefore the number of rulers in each direction from the origin, and\n",
    "each clock has a reading, based on the overall synchronization.  A\n",
    "single event, therefore, can be recorded as happening at the nearest\n",
    "clock (as long as these rulers are imaginary, we can imagine them\n",
    "being as small as we need them to be to achieve the desired spacial\n",
    "resolution), marked at that clock reading: x, y, z, and t.  Those\n",
    "numbers can be collected after the events by bringing the clocks back\n",
    "together and collating their readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept of an infinite lattice of synchronized clocks represents\n",
    "our idea of a \"reference frame\".  As long as we are imagining an infinite\n",
    "lattice, we can imagine a second infinite lattice (or a third, or as\n",
    "many as we like) that is passing through the first, moving at a constant\n",
    "relative velocity.  This velocity could be measured by recording when\n",
    "certain clocks pass each other, and when the clocks are gathered up again\n",
    "later, the number of rulers traveled divided by the durations on the\n",
    "relevant clocks would reveal the relative velocity, which we will\n",
    "designate as $v_R$.  For special relativity, we require that $v_R$\n",
    "be constant."

    "The camera is at rest with respect to the reference frame colored red,\n",

    "Ultimately, we are interested in how objects in the universe move and\n",
    "interact with each other.  To study this motion, we need to make\n",
    "measurements of location and duration, which needs to happen within a\n",
    "chosen reference frame.  Measurements recorded in different reference\n",
    "frame will be compared, but they should never be mixed together.  A\n",
    "displacement measure in one reference frame divided by a duration\n",
    "measured in another reference frame would not represent a real\n",
    "velocity.  An object could be at rest (velocity of zero) in one\n",
    "reference frame, but to observers recording in a second reference\n",
    "frame, moving at a relative velocity to the first, the object would be\n",
    "recorded in different places at different times.  In other words, to\n",
    "the observers at rest with respect to the second reference frame, the\n",
    "object and the lattice of rulers and clocks with it would be moving,\n",
    "not their own lattice of rulers and clocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important assumption we must make about the reference frames\n",
    "we consider in special relativity is that they be \"inertial frames\".\n",
    "What this means, simply expressed, is that Newton's laws are accurate\n",
    "when objects are observed within the frame.  Objects' velocities do\n",
    "not change unless a force acts upon them, momentum and energy are\n",
    "conserved, and so forth.  An example of a non-inertial reference frame\n",
    "would be if you put the reference frame lattice on a carousel.  Using\n",
    "this rotating lattice of rulers and clocks, objects could be observed\n",
    "to move in complicated, changing patterns, without any observable\n",
    "forces causing the changes in motion (so we make up fictitious forces\n",
    "and call them names like \"centrifugal\" to make Newton's laws keep\n",
    "working).  The rules of special relativity only work in inertial\n",
    "reference frames.  Usually, but not always, this means reference\n",
    "frames that have constant velocity, including zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Correlaries to the Postulates\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing physical can travel faster than $c$.  We will see why in later\n",
    "chapters of this book, but it's important to be aware of that from the\n",
    "beginning.  Once you demand that a speed be the same in all reference\n",
    "frames, as the first postulate does, the universe will conspire to\n",
    "make sure nothing moves faster than that.  It's important to note that\n",
    "we call this speed \"the speed of light\", but that's because light,\n",
    "having no inertial mass, moves at the fastest speed possible.  Light\n",
    "will slow down in materials like water or glass, so if we're being\n",
    "careful, we should call this speed \"the speed of light in a vacuum\".\n",
    "But really, it's the speed light moves in a vacuum simply because\n",
    "that's the fastest speed the universe allows.  Anything with no\n",
    "inertial mass will move at that speed (the particles called neutrinos\n",
    "also have almost no mass, and they move that fast, too).  So it is not\n",
    "possible for anything to move from one place to another faster than\n",
    "$c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For precisely that reason, you can't \"just know\" what's happening at\n",
    "some other location than your own.  It takes time for anything, anything\n",
    "that might convey information or have an effect, to move.  Even when\n",
    "you look across the room, you are seeing the room as it was a few\n",
    "nanoseconds ago.  The Moon you see in the sky is the Moon as it was\n",
    "about a second ago.  The Sun that shines on us is the Sun from eight\n",
    "minutes ago.  We often describe physical situations as if we have an\n",
    "instantaneous overview of everything everywhere all at once.  This is\n",
    "impossible.  Even to measure the ends of an object with a ruler demands\n",
    "either moving one's self to the other side of the object, or sending a\n",
    "light beam to the other side and back.  Many misunderstandings and\n",
    "confusions in special relativity arise from people assuming they just\n",
    "know what is going on at another location, without allowing for the\n",
    "time it would take to get from one location to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of special relativity is about comparing measurements according\n",
    "to two different reference frames that are in motion relative to each\n",
    "other.  *Special* relativity demands the assumption that the relative\n",
    "velocity between the frames is constant (a \"special\" case).  If the\n",
    "motion of the reference frames is not constant, the theory must be\n",
    "modified to a more general form, which makes it General Relativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have two different reference frames, it is important to state\n",
    "three characteristics that might seem self-evident, but they have\n",
    "important implications that are worth articulating explicitly.  First,\n",
    "imagine each frame of reference has a set of observers associated with\n",
    "it, or acting within it.  Each set of observers has to agree that the\n",
    "same events happened.  Switching reference frames does not change what\n",
    "actually happens.  People in different reference frames may well\n",
    "disagree on when and where events happen, but they should not disagree\n",
    "on *whether* the events happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, each set of observers must agree on what the results of\n",
    "measurements are.  Not only must there be agreement within the set of\n",
    "observers within a particular reference frame, but each set of\n",
    "observers must agree on what measurements are made in another\n",
    "reference frame.  Those measurements might well contradict each other,\n",
    "but all observers should agree on what they are.  For example, if a\n",
    "set of observers in reference frame 1 agree that a room is 12 m\n",
    "across, a set of observers in reference frame 2 should not be able to\n",
    "truthfully assert that the first set of observers actually measured\n",
    "the room to be 11 m across.  The second set of observers could\n",
    "feasibly measure the room to be 11 m across, themselves, but they\n",
    "should agree that the first set of observers measured 12 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "All sets of observers should agree that causes come before effects.\n",
    "We will find that switching reference frames will change many aspects\n",
    "of space and time that you are used to thinking of as universal.\n",
    "However, causes must still come before effects.  This is, as some have\n",
    "suggested, a kind of definition of time.  As the old saying goes,\n",
    "“Time... is what keeps everything from happening at once.”\n",
    "(R. Cummings, \"The Girl in the Golden Atom\", 1919).  See also [this\n",
    "Science Asylum YouTube\n",
    "video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HBKEDyFTv8).  Not an\n",
    "**operational** definition, mind you, but a useful description.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Then Let's Begin...\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with these postulates, concepts, and principles, we are\n",
    "ready to begin characterizing the universe of space and time,\n",
    "and to discover the surprises waiting therein..."
